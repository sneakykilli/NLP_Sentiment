Sweet Cherry Pie, London,There will be plenty of hangers on who will lend a hand. The RF s a business and its too rich to go under
Mary Pollo, East Kilbride,Oh give it a rest DM 
richard, worcester,Perhaps the king is a closet republican.
romft, wells,"Lets be honest, it is Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles who have brought the monarchy into ill repute with their tawdry behaviour over the past 30 years, and who will ever forget the infantile conversation of him wanting to be her t a m pax,just vile."
romft, wells,a spoilt little boy no less.
unfree777, Newcastle,"don't recall any serious movement in France, Germany or Italy calling for the return of their monarchy. Let's vote! And while we are at it, if the Scottish can vote for independence, why can't the English."
Violet, Peak District,"When George becomes King he'll have his sister and brother as well as his spouse and their spouses, they could all have children old enough to join the firm too. "
WarandPeace, Toronto,Let's get real here. The 'work' they do is really just advertising themselves at public events. It's not hard work and they could stop at any time they want - and not receive their generous funds from public taxpayers.
Capt Sisko, Shropshire,"The Queen, Edinburgh both did public duties into their nineties. Charles & Anne are into their 70s and I expect they will continue to perform royal until they're to infirm to do so. At what age are you going to retire. 65. Hypocrite!"
vinca, Massachusetts,"Here's an oxymoron, ""working royal""."
No bodies fool, Borderland,Getting really fed up with the whole circus now. Give it a rest!
Deirdre, Dublin,"George will bring Harry, Meghan, Archie and Lili back."
RabD, Glasgow,Country cannot afford to support a bloated family whose members have freeloaded on the connections and titles for years.Charles should insist no more hereditary titles to be passed on.You become plain Mr orMrs after the present holder goes
Scottish Snowflake., Colony In The North.,Burnt out. You make it sound like they work for a living. 
Happily retired, Killarney,Maybe he will ask Archie and Lilibet to help! Smile!
Ava Gardner, London,Charles could rethink his part in the decision that Beatrice and Eugenie were not to be included in working royals. 
ramblemania, Wakefield,"Charles is a weak, vain, selfish ninny who can't keep his nose out of politics.He was pathetically jealous of his first wife's popularity and he was a rubbish husband. If the royal family want to become cheerleaders for Net Zero and all in favour of their subjects having a poorer, colder, worse life then let's have a Republic, because none of us need more elitists telling us to eat locust burgers whilst tucking into red wine and steaks themselves!"
Dianaismyqueen, London,Totally agree! BTW Charlie wants to be last reign of this country it is only way he will be remembered in history. Diana will always be missed and loved and greater of all. When I see his tantrums I think poor Diana Camilla does not pay attention to his tantrums in carriage and with pen as she is cold blooded!
RVXXXX, Santa Fe,What is the point of a slimmed down monarchy when the cost of this monarchy remains the same?
Dianaismyqueen, London,if he had low key coronation he would have money to pay then ahahah
TinaTinaTina, Somewhere or other,Very few of us believe that George will ever be king. Hopefully the monarchy will be gone by then.
Dianaismyqueen, London,it is disputable even for William
BarryPrince, Windsor,"The Fr0gs had the right idea on how to deal with their monarchy once for all, but now they've  ended up with Macaron Napoleon IV, a pipsqueak who thinks he's the emperor of F rance. Was it worth it?"
Happily retired, Killarney,You Brits always love to put down men who are short! 
Upamountain, Geneva,And has the lack of a monarchy solved any of the problems?
Orion25, New York,"All supposition, You cant predict who what and when. For goodness sake , go spout your rubbish somewhere else."
unfree777, Newcastle,"If the English were given the chance to vote we would choose independence, for sure, and quite probably a republic. But our 'democracy' won't allow us the opportunity."
Galla Placidia, Atlanta,Your independence?  Isn't the UK a sovereign nation?  
unfree777, Newcastle,"so Scotland can, but England can't?"
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"The Royals are banking on the majority of the public not believing the people who know the truth about them. It won't last long. The old 'the bigger the lie the more they will believe it,' tactic just won't work for you anymore I'm afraid. "
Only Sycophants, Are Published,That's the thing - you can't even say hard facts (considered detrimental) about them in the Mail. 
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,There's a big reason for that.
Bobbyripandroar, Miami,It will be a very long time before 9 year old George takes over if the monarchy is even still there.
TMMuir, Malaga,"All supposition, You cant predict who what and when. For goodness sake , go spout your rubbish somewhere else.

"
warose, Sydney,"What a silly way of putting those numbers together, after the King and queen it should have gone in a straight line."
lallala, new york,George has his great aunts and uncles and their children plus his siblings. The monarchy has survived for thousands of years don't you worry lol
couldntcare, upper ducks bottom,When the Kent's and the Gloucesters are too old just bring in Eugenie and Beatrice. Simples
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"These blood princesses don't get on with Kate after she walked past them with her nose in the air, and giggled behind her hand about them to her equally-calculating sister "
Rocinante_Frigate, Chelmsford,Burnt out??? They're hardly working long shifts in an Amazon warehouse!
Freya., Little Britain ,"I agree, it's been slimmed down too much!
The BRF will need more working royals even before Prince George ascends the throne. Charles has a 2 siblings, his son , daughter in-law and relatives to add to his mix of a slimmed down monarchy. Don't mean to be rude but most of them are very old.
William has now no sibling or cousins in the line up as working royals to be. I foresee the Cambridges needing more working royals to help before George even starts uni. Can't rely on his siblings, they  may grow up to live lives outside royal duty. "
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"One day, hopefully in yours and my lifetime, the world will know the depth of the lies from these people. It is truly shocking, trust me."
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,Unfortunately people can't reveal the truth for fear for their lives. 
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"By the way, interesting that you are from New York."
Geldsman, Halifax,By the time George's turn comes around the British monarchy should hopefully be in its final death throes.
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"Exactly. Nobody wants to see smug, calculating Carole waltzing about and pushing William around."
Russiamom, Texaa,"Use Zara, Beatrice, Eugenia and also Louise and James after they graduate from college."
Ready for Hols, Warrington,They all look clapped out to me.  Get rid
Wee Annie, Cockermouth,More rubbish from as so called Royal journalist.
Francis Burke, San Francisco,"Ask yourself, what sort of people actually like to play dress up like this?"
MWblue, Lost in the Wind,"Right now, in Spain, there are only 3 members of the Royal Family who work for the monarchy: King Felipe, Queen Letizia and Queen Sofia."
dwarf slaughter, midgetville,I think they could die out with the Boomers 
JohnBullEngland, BroadSunlitUplandsWITHunicorns,The Good News just keeps on coming ...
Banjo Bill, Ripley,They didn't look in jeapardy
Calmlyy, None,"Do not blame Harry and Megan, the monarchy is NOT FLEXIBLE FOR MODERN TIMES.  EUGINIE, BEATRICE, HARRY AND MEGAN, even Zara and Peter, could and should be given part time working royal roles. The monarchy is the one that wont do it.  So they have old people, who no one really cares about seeing. The firm is not very bright when it comes to selling themselves.  "
Weynetta, The Seventies,"Don't forget Edwards 2! I expect Charles has at least 20 years, then Will's kids will be well old enough to serve. And if Harry's kids want to go back to The Firm, what's to stop them?"
couldntcare, upper ducks bottom,"There is constant public criticism about there being too many of them, not who they are or how old"
Dev971, Notts,"Supporters are always saying Camilla was Charlies one true love. If that's so, would you not want to have a child with you're ""one true love""? I would bet that Camillas children are actually Charlie's children. They were having an affair with each other throughout their marriages. AP Bowles was obviously just their wingman (he was invited to the coronation). Don't be surprised when Charlie starts dishing out titles, lordships etc etc to all his real ""family"" soon. I'm sure they will help out too, they already did so at the coronation."
Charming Charlotte, Oxford,"Look at a photo of Camilla's children, particularly her son, next to her ex husband. They look exactly alike. No doubt in my mind that APB is their father."
Only Sycophants, Are Published,Depends what you define as an affair? Charles was unmarried when Camilla wed and had her children. 
Mrs. Baggins, The Shire,Purrrr-lease. Eye roll.
Stephanie, Los Angeles,It's amazing how much George looks more and more like Kate the older he gets. All three children were beautifully behaved and looked adorable.
Patrickh, Nuneaton,RUBBISH.
average american, Pittsburg,To do WHAT exactly ? The term working royal is surely made in jest? They will also have fewer duties as more Commonwealth countries realize they don't want them
Alberto Semifreddo, Leeds,"Bring in the Tindalls! Both Zara and Mike are personalities who pop, and they bring the SQ (Stuffiness Quotient) down 30 points. They would be a tremendous asset."
Mrs. Baggins, The Shire,Except for the part where they are not royals.
Kathrynmarie, Tamworth,"What a load of tosh! Plenty of younger royals available that I am sure would help if they are paid a salary, Beatrice, Eugenie, princess Anne's kids or they just do fewer engagements and, Charlotte, George and Louis will come of age and be supported by William and Catherine."
michaela4m, trenton,"HOW STUPID IS IT TO HAVE A MONARCHY!!  HOPEFULLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE THIS OUTDATED C**P WILL BE GONE FOR GOOD.  I COULDN""T STOP LAUGHING AT ALL THEM PLAYING DRESS UP AND CARRIAGE RIDES THE PAST WEEKEND."
Mistyfields, Plymouth,"William and Kate have had such an easy ride so far, it's about time they did something more meaningful. They certainly don't seem to have a passion for anything."
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"They have a ""passion"" for any passing, popular bandwagon. "
Fru-T-Bunn, Blighty,"They appear to have a passion for their royal residences, helicopters, chauffeur driven limos, an army of fawning servants, unlimited designer wardrobes - the list is endless."
Pat57, Exeter,Only a DM journalist could write an article that ignores the fact that Prince George has two siblings and that by the time he becomes King it's likely that not only will they all be adults but may well have children of their own.
toriat, Wheaton,What makes anyone think they will want to make a job of supporting King George.
FLOTUS, London,Charles is the last king.
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"Hopefully. Not looking forward to the Goldsmith-Middleton-Windsor grifters. At least Gary's keeping his mouth shut, his nose clean and his fists to himself "
ZeZe, Glasgow,It won't last that long
JEODB, Oostende,"... 'leaving Kate and William to do it all,'... What exactly???"
Cottage Cat, Colchester,Kate's in it for the least output and maximum return. As are her family 
Aphrodite4574, Midlands,"Dont talk so much rubbish, theres still enough Royals to perform the roles."
DemocracyRules, TheLandOfMilkAndHoney,No reason to think we need The Harkles back!
Yeeeaaahhh, Earth,Be lovely if the Princess of Wales had another baby....
Enigma, South Shields,Bringing up small children ties them quite a bit as they want to be more hands on than the late Queen of Charles.  Bringing in another  baby ties them even longer.   It is a pity they did not marry and start a family a little earlier.
jpc001, Essex,"By the time he takes the throne, it will be a very different Britain anyway"
Loftboy, Brisbane,"Why is ""BURNT-OUT"" in CAPITALS?"
twinkletoes, perth,"I said that the other day, that the majority  of them will be in nursing  homes in the next 5-10 years. It will just leave a working Royal family of 6. Cause George will be to young. There will be nobody left to help Charles  if he lives as long as his parents  never mind William  or George."
Artemis Fowle, Edinburgh,The generations below 65 have no interest in anything other than their personal lives and paycheques. 
Dev971, Notts,"Yeah, they should be interested in a couple of geriatric adulterers. How dare they not be."
anne, sheffield,Do all those ribbons really need to be cut? Hospitals open well without a minor royal saying it's now open.  Still unsure why Edward and all the letters after his name and all those unearned  medals  was asked to open the brilliant Ashgate Hospice.  I very much doubt he offered to help you n the kitchens or take the meals round.
Dev971, Notts,The public just paid tens of millions for a billionaire to have a party to celebrate his supposed supremacy over the public. Truth is stranger than fiction.
piscesmoonchild, Oldham,the public just paid for the Coronation of the head of state which hasn't happened for 70 years.  Barrack Obama's inauguration cost $170 million dollars in 2009 alone
Dev971, Notts,"Barack Obama happened to be the president of the richest country in the world. In this country we have serious cost of living crisis and strikes galore because people are not being paid a living wage. It's all about perspective and circumstances dear. The Queen understood this, greedy selfish Charlie does not."
John_Watson, New Hampshire,"There may not be a monarchy by the time George's turn comes around. And while I am not necessarily a republican, a feudal anachronism like this serves no useful purpose in the British Isles or elsewhere."
Bearly Eagle, Bedrock,"The no shortage of royals to do work, only a shortage of "" work"" for royals to do. Unless you count unveiling and waving as work."
pixi50, Murcia,I don't think the monarchy will still be there by the time George becomes of king.
Bearly Eagle, Bedrock,Let's hope
Dev971, Notts,I hope so too. Leaches on the public purse.
Sweet Suzy, DC,"The family seems to have worked this out with the larger foundations - starting with Philip's Duke of Edinburgh Awards. And in any case, the Wales were not late so stop telling that lie."
Only Sycophants, Are Published,"Well something went very wrong Suzy! The Wales were supposed to access from the West Gate (side entrance) and be seated after all the other VIPs were seated and only Camilla and Charles were supposed to enter from the grand West Door, Charles being last as he is the King and it's his Coronation.  It means William and Catherine were sharing his choral acclaim  - think of it like the mother in law following the bride down the aisle."
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"Only Sycophants, exactly. Kate hates being outshone, even by the King. She is addicted to the limelight and has done it many times before. This was no accident."
Willis , Willis,Ol' mate on the left end looks like he's sh. Hit his pants.
Artemis Fowle, Edinburgh,He's 89 and still turning up to support the monarchy.  How will you be doing at  89?
None so wise, England,Couldn't they have an equal number of republicans volunteer to attend the events for food and champagne and then compare the value added at the end of a year.
Dev971, Notts,Charlie just inherited over 650 million pounds. He did not pay a penny in inheritance tax on this. I'm sure he can afford all the help required.
Artemis Fowle, Edinburgh,You can't buy members of a family.
Dev971, Notts,"He doesn't need to, he already has a family."
None so wise, England,"Just imagine being paid millions to attend functions, that would carry on just as well if you weren't there?"
Artemis Fowle, Edinburgh,He's funded by the country to represent them and bring some impartial gravitas to functions. It would be very different if all you call on would be the cast of Eastenders.
None so wise, England,Can't they recruit volunteers to be chauffeured to their next glass of champagne? 
Dom Diddy Dom, London,They need to get Harry and Princess Meghan on board they're the only royals the public care about.
twinkletoes, perth,George might want to do to them what William  did to his. I'm sure the press will happily  going after prince Louis going by some of the recent headlines in them.
Englishlovee, Groton,"No thats not happening. And no, they have been called out as liers and greedy world wide"
lizabella, Los Angeles,"Very good points. At last someone is addressing this. Princess Alexandra has been retired for years, so there are only 9 working royals next to C&C in the photo.  Even more pressing - who will be there to support the Waleses when the older generation is no longer there? In ten years, their children will only be 19, 18, and 15. W&C will have to enlist their cousins, or there will only be a few people to handle the over 3,000 patronages."
None so wise, England,"Why what value do they actually add, I'd suggest none it's all just pretend work to justify their millions of taxpayers cash."
None so wise, England,"When the people over 65 unfortunately pass on, so too will support for the Monarchy."
Robin2000, The Emerald City,"I think Princess Beatrice should have a role, if she wants it. She seems lovely and has never put a foot wrong. It's completely unfair to disqualify her because of her awful parents - quite the opposite in fact, as she seems to have turned out very well in the face of huge family difficulties. All of this applies equally to Eugenie,  but I'm not sure if she would want the role given her loyalty to the Sussexes. But if so, I think Beatrice and Eugenie would be wonderful working royals. They seem so mature and well-behaved. And they were born princesses - what more could you want!"
ToriesRFinito, Red Wall,Only the Mail are buying this slimmed down monarchy nonsense. This family will never stop grifting.
Fernie, Dunblane,"""noone left to help..."" Help to do what exactly?"
Dev971, Notts,The RF have a plan to deal with this... simply send Camilla to all engagements.  The requests will soon stop (except to Halloween parties)
Socalgal64, San Diego,Haha!
Dev971, Notts,"They will have to get more servants employed in, to iron Charlie's shoelaces everyday"
Dev971, Notts,They should all do what Camilla does. Everytime she gets a tedious assignment she gets Covid and goes into hibernation.
Gary, Stoke,"Whether in the future it is a large or small ""working"" monarchy, it will be largely irrelevant. By the time Charles goes (if he has another 20 in him) all those teenagers and early 20 somethings of today who will be going into middle age as tax payers having had predominantly zero interest in monarchy all their lives, will be asking some petty searching questions as to what relevance or purpose do these people actually serve? My 'boomer' generation who are their core remaining 'fan' base will be all but gone and then who will they have left in favour of continuance? Whilst people tend to be more conservative with age, they do not become more deferential; indeed quite the reverse. It is all on borrowed time now QE2 is no more and no matter how much juggling Charles does."
Gary, Stoke,"Dev- Yes, it's a shame he didn't pay for it out of his Inheritance Tax bill he 'divinely' avoided and it would have still left him 150M up on the deal that you or I would have got. Xname - Agree. Youngsters today (who will be those I speak of in the future) follow the cult of celebrity and not monarchy and as much as some of my generation may sneer at that, they do so by CHOICE and not because someone starting at school tells them they are obliged to 'respect' and revere them as 'special people' or even in Charles' case, 'divine'."
michaela4m, trenton,"I agree.  All this monarchy nonsense has got to go.  Carriage rides, crowns, tiaras, ribbon cutting.  It's all so ridiculous."
shadowtoo, Lansdale,"there's a major flaw in this as you say 'excluding Wales and Edinburgh, well that cuts out the 4 people who will help george- his 2 siblings and 2 cousins all on his level. by leaving them out you're article becomes meaning less. It's like writing 'there's nothing to stop the north koreans from taking the whole peninsula, so long as you don't mention the US and south Korean armies. "
toriat, Wheaton,What makes you think Charlotte and Louis will want that kind of life? There is no guarantee.
Dev971, Notts,Charlie will have to get more in to help carry the carrier bags of cash gifted from dodgy sheiks.
Batter, London,I ve always liked Princess Beatrice and as the eldest daughter of a Duke I feel she would really contribute to a role in royal life I believe shes also close to the King too
mammadub, nj,"Still remembering the attention grab at the William's wedding.  Did someone make her wear that hat?  And if so, who?"
Gary, Stoke,"And what life experiences could she share with 'the little people' on her walkabouts pray tell other than discussing her memoirs of hedonism, parties, luxury holidays and 'jobs' allowing her 9 months a year staff absence to pursue all those things mentioned ..?"
TonyTCClark, Herts,End the monarchy and it's job done!!
Lee Dunn, Glasgow,why do any of them need help?  They dont do anything!!
WanderingSadie, Northeast,they keep DM in business
Dev971, Notts,This is what I don't understand. They have virtually unlimited funds and resources. What do they actually DO with all that???? Why is it never reported on. Is it just opening places and making visits???
Dunno mate, Eastbourne,"""To date, the Waleses appear to have approached their increased workload with dedication and ease""... Workload? Sorry. You've lost me there. "
Pat57, Exeter,The initial aim of the Civil War wasn't to remove the King but to force him to accept the supremacy of Parliament. For various reasons the side that won decided to abolish the monarchy and execute him. In order to do this they used the army to prevent MPs who were opposed to the abolition from entering Parliament and voting against it. As with the French and Russian revolutions no one asked the people what they wanted.
Gary, Stoke,Pat57 - I think joining the ranks of the Parliamentarian Army to rid the country of absolute monarchy and subjective (then) tyranny rather than join the Royalist ranks was an effective vote or choice by 'the people' involved and risking their lives don't you think and irrespective of how you present it...? Who was 'forced against their wishes' to storm the Bastille or the Winter Palace as well...?
hunkeydorey, London,"I'm still absolutely FUMING that Harry and Meghan were cynically edited out of the Royal Coronation group photograph. It's blatant discrimination, pure and simple."
Only Sycophants, Are Published,Shooting fish in a barrel. 
disgusted_of, Hull,Don't say that you are fuming and spoil the Coronation for Charles.
Dev971, Notts,"I would bet that Camillas children are actually Charlie's children. They were having an affair with each other throughout their marriages. AP Bowles was obviously just their wingman (he was invited to the coronation). Don't be surprised when Charlie starts dishing out titles, lordships etc etc to all his real ""family"" soon. I'm sure they will all help out. They already did at the coronation."
Commonsence Norfolk, Kings lynn,Do you mean in the same way a lot of people dont believe Harry is Charles son? (Which would explain his behaviour) But as the King accepted him and stood by him from the start others have had to accept his decision.
Dev971, Notts,I can see Charlie in them too. He was certainly in Camilla enough during the time they were both married to other people (remember t*mp*x gate)
hognog, Birmingham,FGS George is only 9 years old - things may look very different when he becomes king - William has yet to become king - hopefully not for another 20 years or so.
XnameX, Little Britain,"Yes, things may indeed, William is the last king to have a coronation and when it is George's turn, tje role of RF has significantl diminished and George won't have to worry about the whole thing"
disgusted_of, Hull,"The Prince and Princess of. Wales may even have more children.
"
Kevin, Rhyl,Name another job where you have to employ people now to make sure your employees Grandson doesnt have to work to hard when he gets the job  !!!! Shows the pure insanity of having a Hereditary Monarchy .
Cristabell, Nottingham,Name another job where you work on the world stage til you die
Kevin, Rhyl,"Shouldnt that read work part time with hours you pick for yourself   ?? And lets be honest King Charles is 74 in years to come that will be the average retirement age the way things are going after working in a proper full time job since leaving school, I know which job I would pick if given the chance ."
md56, UK,He has siblings and no doubt they will have families. George will not be on his own!
Milly, Hampshire,Williams sibling is no help so it's not a given
XnameX, Little Britain,"Didn't DM just tell us that Waleses bring Charlotte and Louis up thinking that they will have to work for their living, meaning not as ""working royals"" but have a proper profession? "
Allsenseisgone, Somewhere,It's SOMEWHAT a shame (I know - I know - not everyone will agree) that Bea and Euge have been placed in the chiller.  They are loyal to the crown and could help out a lot.  But their dad sort of ruined THAT for them.   And M just plain ruined a lot as well.  Always having to be mindful of her lurking in the background and so you have a lot of hand wringing as a result.  If only.....
Fernie, Dunblane,"What does "" loyal to the crown "" mean?"
Pat57, Exeter,I think its more a case of their non-existent 'careers' and their habit of going on frequent holidays that ruined it for them
Edknowall, Guildford,Does it mean the tax payers is will save money then?
Carole Anne Troops, Grntham,"The duke and Duchess of Edinburgh have two fine children, I'm sure they will do their duty just as their parents do.
"
USA11, Miami,"King needs to make it worth their while. Slippery slope towards entitlement, but the Wessex children and Zara have proper attitudes."
WarandPeace, Toronto,"Look, these chumps live a life of luxury from birth but all we hear are complaints about how 'hard' they have to work. Clearly are tone deaf when you think of the public - their subjects - who pay to have them prance around in fine clothing - who have to work hard all their lives and may not have much of a pension to live off after that. Spare me the tears"
Galla Placidia, Atlanta,It does seem that the Wales and the Cambridges may have to bear a heavier burden given the ages of the others.  Perhaps Beatrice should be considered as a possibility. Not sure about Eugenie and her loyalty.
Fernie, Dunblane,Get a life!
Dev971, Notts,"@fernie... you can't ""get a life"" Fernie. You are life, just like me, you and everyone else."
Daniel_Butcher_666, London,"Okay, so he has a brother and a sister.  By the time he takes the throne, he will be married with his own children and will have nephews and nieces.  Failing that his great-uncles and aunt have families - so there's a big pool to draw from (without going anywhere near his uncle and that awful actress)"
jontty, Anyways ,Charles is a fool. The crown should gave passed him over. Imbecile 
Stanley Bunfluff, Manchester,Whoever wrote this doesn't understand history or the monarchy. She should go back to school.
Kevin, Rhyl,"Hey thats no way to talk about a DM Royal Expert , now if she was writing an article based purely on speculation slagging off Harry and Meghan youd be swallowing it hook line and sinker  ."
Thought_, Shannon,No idea who the writer if this article is...but clearly she isn't that bright.
Cooper, Cambridge,"What rot. Families grow, marriages are made and children born. If ALL the people currently described as ""Royal Family"" are retained as such, before long there will be so many, they'd fill Westminster Cathedral on their own. There has to be a ""slimming down"" every so often. At least we don't have the historical methods (usually involving blood and burials) any more."
Pat57, Exeter,George V started the slimming down in 1917 when he took the sensible step of limiting the titles of Prince and Princess to the grandchildren of a monarch. You only have to look at other Royal Family trees to see dozens of Princes and Princesses or their equivalent such as Archdukes and Archduchesses - many of whom are the great-grandchildren several times removed of a monarch.
Lolly310, Hampshire,No one left to help George? Surely he'll have his siblings? Even his parents will be getting on if not deceased so who do you suggest helps him?
Calmbfstorm, Lancs,And his cousins sienna augustus and the new baby if they want

hellsbells, london,What a ridiculous article.  
disgusted_of, Hull,click bait
taitm22, Sheffield,"George has a brother and a sister.  And they may all have children by then, who could help too."
Fernie, Dunblane,I'll help!
Freya., Little Britain ,"But what if they don't want to and opt for a life outside of royal duties? The picture consists of an extended family. The BRF will need more working royals even before Prince George ascends the throne. Charles has a 2 siblings, his son , daughter in-law and relatives to add to his mix of a slimmed down monarchy. Don't mean to be rude but most of them are very old.
William has no sibling or cousins in the line up as working royals to be. I foresee the Cambridges needing more working royals to help with appearances before George even starts uni. It's been slimmed down too much!"
Sue, Wiltshire,"Here's an idea. Get rid of the monarchy.
Problem solved."
Cristabell, Nottingham,President Sunak anyone?
michaela4m, trenton,The monarchy seriously has to go.  
normanby1, Middlesbrough,Couldn't care less
disgusted_of, Hull,yet you post on here.
Lizurley, WestEnd,George will have his own family by then as well as help from his siblings and their families. Why focus on something that might never be - a little bit more optimism from the DM wouldnt go amiss!
WarandPeace, Toronto,"Public support for a monarchy will have waned further by the time he's King, so it won't matter. Do you think people who really have to work hard for their entire life, with limited pensions, are really going to worry about all this concern for the Monarchy? They live a life of absolute luxury from birth."
Violet, Peak District,"William could have Louise and James working with him by then, as well as Catherine, Charlotte and Louis. Perhaps the York girls will have proven themselves by then too, although that remains to be seen."
Chester1965, Chester,About time they had to stand on their own two feet just like the rest of us !
Tree lady, Nottingham,"Don,t worry the Middleton,s will be more than happy to help out..."

Steven - Universe, Nowhere,Many who help now will be long gone by the time George takes over which will leave a burnt-out king.
VaderoTu, London,"Let's be honest, Margaret was also giving it away like free samples back then. "
Surprise2022, Northeast,She married a bisexual after her sister stopped her relationship with the  man she wished to marry.

Haglet, Cheltenham,"No doubt she would have liked to have kept all the perks, but she valued being fawned over far more than being plain Mrs Townsend, hence her decision. Townsend had a lucky escape."
Earth Mother, north wales,Oh FGS! Real life does not come with no restrictions! She chose not to marry him.
Rogue Roi, Manchester,He batted at both ends of the wicket.
Joy, Up Country Down South,I agree. Can't believe this hasn't been mentioned in the extract so far !!
Good goolie, United Kingdom ,I bet she never knew if she'd be face up or face down.  No woman can deal with that.
Barbara Smegg, East Finchley ,Whoever she married it wouldn't have lasted.
Agnostic nr 1 , No Where ,Didn't the queen forbid her to marry her true love? 
Meg, Penge Sur Mer,No.
Earth Mother, north wales,No. She chose not to
SCossey, England,She wasnt spirited - she was spoilt and indulged excessively.
Surprise2022, Northeast,They all are.
bugs, seattle,She only married him because she wanted to marry before Peter Townsend married someone else.
DavetheSmythe, Indian Heaven,A spare who stayed for privilege and wealth only to become a bitter alcoholic.
Aphrodite4574, Midlands,"Why resurrect this now, its old history, for goodness sake stop reporting on rubbish like this that no one has the slight bit of interest in."
lifescrap77, Stoke on trent,I'm interested. 
Earth Mother, north wales,"Are you not interested in history Aphrodite, especially with a name like yours? Shame that. You might learn something."
SeftonParkExile, London,No mention of Snowden's desire for men?
OhYeahRight, Houston,"Margaret was known notoriously for her wit and sharp tongue.  During a visit to the Met in NY, she was in a receiving line.  When one lady asked, ""How is the Queen?,"" Without missing a beat, Margaret answered, ""Of whom are you inquiring,? My sister,? My mother,? Or my husband.?""  True story."
Bablob, London,And pop z
Joe 90, Shrewsbury,History tells us that the majority of the royals were serial philanderers.
Box56, Bolton,Not just the royals but most of the upper class. Apparently it was acceptable behaviour!
Robert, London,Even the working classes are known to be at it.
Joe 90, Shrewsbury,Something about a second hand dart board comes to mind
UK is a Cesspit, Benidorm,Their lives funded by the taxpayer!
Tony Lee Deaf, Some Nasty Suburb Somewhere,Sleazy.
rivet, Atlanta,"I remember that wedding, I was a child and so excited about it. But the  trouble is Princess Margaret knew what he was before she married him. Probably thought that because he would now be living a high-profile life he would go easy with his normal lifestyle of anything goes in the sex department. But he didn't."
bugs, seattle,She was more afraid of being embarrassed by Peter Townsend getting married to someone else.  She could have married him - she didn't want to give up the perks of royal life.
Damico, Cheltenham,Why this article about princesses Margaret?  I wish the DM would leave the dead alone. 
HerInDoors, Sussex,"Another 'spare' who needed a defined role, and who went off the rails because they didn't fit in anywhere.
I really hope meaningful roles and a purpose in life are found for Charlotte and Louis."
Jinine Carla, Brisbane,She had a bad marriage to a selfish cad. Bit like harry 
Haglet, Cheltenham,"Im sure that. Charlotte and Louis will do far better than Margaret, a sharp tongued wretch who loved the trappings and deference that went with being a member of the RF, and never having to do a days work in her lazy, pointless life."
Sharpes Eagle, Talavera,Six of one
bigjac20, Atlanta,It's a different world for the rich!
Yes but no but, City,What is the point of this article. Utter rubbish and a waste of time.
Shopper100, Derby,"He probably wasn't happy with her because she was a woman, from the article on here the other week that wasn't his preference "
Earth Mother, north wales,He had no preference.
Haglet, Cheltenham,He swung both ways.
jpaob, Claremorris,"I remember hearing that Princess Margaret once called Boy George, an over made up tart."
Haglet, Cheltenham,"Well, she should have known!"
ReadyFready, AnotherWorld,"She had a queen for a grandmother, mother, sister and husband."
Orest, Oakville,"I was never a fan of Princess Margaret.  While very beautiful, she didn't seem to have any normal survival instincts and just floundered her entire life.  Couldn't marry Peter Townsend and ended up marrying the worst kind of man possible.  She was a raging alcoholic, a heavy smoker and partier and from all accounts, a complete nightmare to work for.  Can't believe how different she was from her sister."
Theoldgirl, Pompy,"Perhaps if she had married her first love, things would have been different."
Earth Mother, north wales,Orest & Old girl. She CHOSE not to marry Townsend. She didn't want to give up her position. Says it all.
deb notts, nottingham,"Why call siblings of royalty "" spare "" , Judy asking for trouble ! Harry is the youngest child of the king , leave it at that ."
jpaob, Claremorris,Lord Snowdon was also a child of divorce. Now his son David has divorced. Some of these evils run in families.
Stanley Bunfluff, Manchester,Wonder if he took his boots off?
Realhull, Hull,"Mags had her fair share on that holiday island, and allegedly, there's pics to prove."
Not Amused, Portsmouth,"He was not Tony Snowdon, he was Antony Armstrong Jones. The title Lord Snowdon was given to him by the Queen when he married Margaret. They were both an utter disaster. Both were having affairs. Him more often than not with other men and was rubbing her nose in it. They were like two alley cats. Her behaviour when they split was appalling. Everyone had to bow to her and call he your highness. She was by far the biggest disgrace to the RF than anyone else. Her constant drinking and smoking helped her demise."
SophiaH, Kent,"I'm sure that she should have realised what he was like before she married him after all what sort of a man sleeps, not only with his best friend but also with his best friend's wife!"
Earth Mother, north wales,She knew
Zlisters, Kings Lynn,What a glamorous down to earth royal lady. I miss her......
Jarrad9911, Melbourne,There'll be another divorce of the decade shortly. Can't wait
CheekyRose, Homeland,He sounds like a very childish and immature man. She should have divorced him immediately. 
Jack, London,The fact that he was sexually attracted to other men obviously didn't help their matrimonial harmony!
Earth Mother, north wales,I don't think he was fussed either way 
Mr Badinage, Gomorrah,She was as bad as he was! Cocked more times than Jessie James gun!
Vimto88, London,Margaret got married in 1960 so not 20 years
Jarah_Seabass, Devonshire ,"This timeline of the affair with Barton has to be off. Margaret and Antony married in 1960 and their son David was born in 1961. I doubt she was having an affair around that time because the marriage was happy then. It says that Margaret had the affair which eventually came to Antony's attention and he and the friend didn't speak to each other for 'many years' until their daughter Sarah's christening, but she was born in 1964, which wasn't many years later. Was that supposed to say Sarah's wedding? That indeed would be many years later. "
anne, sheffield,she was worse. . . . I'm a princess bow to me  she was far worse 
FeathrrsMcGraw, KAIMUKI Honolulu Hawaii,"It's  just awful to print the intimate details of a life , no matter who the person is . I had to stop reading , because , I was feeling humiliated for Margaret. "
Murdoch-notinmyname, Milton Keynes,It suggests that Lord Snowdon just wanted the status of the marriage and not the woman.
mancunian, Oswestry,Like a certain other person.
G.A.MACKINLAY, in New South Wales,"If only Princess Margaret had been allowed to marry Peter Townsend, things would have been vastly different!"
G.A.MACKINLAY, in New South Wales,"Could I suggest to the commentators, that they do some research into the love affair between Peter Townsend and Princess Margaret!"
Earth Mother, north wales,"Where do these silly stories come from? Margaret CHOSE not to marry Townsend because she would have had to give up her royal position & place in the succession. But the point is that she had a choice, a choice she herself made."
MSSD19, Port Credit,Ladies do not ever date or marry a man who sleeps with both sexes. Ever
Jarah_Seabass, Devonshire ,Exactly. Gross. It's why she really died of Ai-never mind. 
Earth Mother, north wales,"Well they do. She did. Jarah, stop the silly gossiping. She died after her 4th stroke due to her heavy smoking habit."
pig nose, Nowheresville,The type of people that make ordinary folk despise royal privilege. 
Enigma, South Shields,Plenty at the other end of the scale act badly.
SkeatsMC, erehwon,"Royal 'spares' are never treated very well in this family. A good idea for Charles to slim down his family and make some outliers work for their livings. Princess Margaret's children both work in the creative side and keep a low profile, so they did benefit from their father's talents, rather than their mother's. They still stayed loyal to their mother and that says something for her love for them."
taurean, loftus,"spares will always be spares  as they were down the ages,away back to Victoria,and Albert ,their hearts were sore trying to sort out their spare who gave them  a bad time.doesn`t matter what Charles will do, he can`t change tradition."
WIND BLOWN, Wellington,I have not read the article.  My thoughts are for the family of Princess Margaret.   Is there anything to be achieved from digging into the past of someone who has died a long time ago.   Let her rest in peace and let her family live their lives without this intrusiveness into the life of Princess Margaret.
Jarah_Seabass, Devonshire ,Tough. That's what happens when you live in the public eye and pretend to be better than the rest of us. We then love proving that you're not. 
On the move, Molde,Not relevant and why this week... show some respect.
Aristotle, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh,Respect? Ha Ha Ha
Hiljadu, Bordeaux,"I always suspected that he was arrogant, spoilt & not a very nice ,small man. .... I notice in these photos, that Snowden was not very much taller than Margaret.  Having seen her 'in the flesh', arriving at the theatre, I was really shocked at how diminutive she was. She was under 5ft, I think."
SeniorSouthCoast, Hove,"But Tony had size where it mattered, a much gossiped about fact. "
Aristotle, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh,But very well-hung apparently Lucky blighter
christineispristine, Watford,This is the life of royalty and the aristocracy and us plebs are supposed to bow and curtsy ...Margaret a spoilt child young woman and that never changed..another spare that wasn't happy with her lot.
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"One day, hopefully in yours and my lifetime, the world will know the depth of the lies from these people. It is truly shocking, trust me."
MSSD19, Port Credit,Nothing that will shock anyone anymore
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,I wouldn't be so sure about that. Think the unthinkable and you won't be far off.
JoshRipley, Metropolis,Compelling Mail extract from 2017....why is it being regurgitated now?
Fernie, Dunblane,None of this is remotely interesting or relevant.
SeftonParkExile, London,"For those saying she should've married Townsend...it probably wouldn't have lasted in the long term. Margaret was very young at the time and would've eventually got bored of her considerably older partner. She was impulsive and very spoilt. She would have renounced her royal status/privilege,if she truly loved him!"
Josephine Public, The Cotswolds Gloucestershire,She was too old for Townsend and he soon moved on to another young girl.
Tom, Swansea,It's the gene Harry has?
Miss L E, Liverpool,It's amazing that their children turned out so normal. 
Josephine Public, The Cotswolds Gloucestershire,Sarah is a solid Windsor like the Queen and Queen Mother but David has more of the Armstrong-Jones in him.
The funny man, Belfast,Another breaking news story from the DM 47 years later.
pse2411, seaside,"I am sure all the world and his wife know well the story of these two ..... the pair I feel sorry for are son David and daughter Sarah, both of whom are lovely people and were cared for by their aunt the Queen.  It would be a good idea to leave the story of Margo and Armstrong-Jones alone.   Leave the son and daughter in peace."
Earth Mother, north wales,I'm sure they are already very familiar with it.
toby40, lymington,the family have been dysfunctionl for decades. Time to bin eastenders in posh frocks
ALIA, Australia,But people love eastenders. And posh frocks.
Larkinaboat, Dorchester,"The protocols so loved by royals. Only there to remind people they believe them selves to be so superior. Eating, if you are slower than the rest fine, but to have the first served kick of without waiting, no manners full stop.
Brought up to wait until all had been served then start, just a decent thing to do and usually lively conversation and  maybe drink a litlle more wine as the slower eater caught up.
"
toby40, lymington,to busy trying to get to the powder room for as g&t with its mother! 
The Borg, Liverpool,she's seen more ceilings than Michael Angelo.
Katherine52, Rome,Michelangelo - at least get the spelling right (and his surname was Buonarroti)
toby40, lymington,"@katie! Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, known as Michelangelo. That would be the correct name dear! "
SummerWoman, Dublin,Who on earth would want to work for or be friends with people like that. The eating protocol and her appalling manners alone were awful.
SeniorSouthCoast, Hove,"My friend was valet to Lord Snowdon for 7 years from the time soon after their marriage. There were many stories, almost unbelievable to me at the time. "
Meg, Penge Sur Mer,"SeniorSouthCoast: That wasn't Malcolm H, by any chance, was it? I worked with him after he left their employ and heard something of their ""exploits"" long before it was public knowledge."
Us, In the UK,"Tart in a tiara. Watch the film The Bank Job, starring   Jason Statham, you will love it"
Marx, Bucks,He liked men like many of the royals; it doesn't mix well in a marriage.

ALIA, Australia,They were a great match
Se3bla, London,Headline news...lol
TeaOne, Manchester,"Two narcissists together. Oh, the drama! "

Calmbfstorm, Lancs,Puerile article
null, 7 hours ago,"And she had the nerve to write to Fergie telling her she was a disgrace to the family, kettle and pot I think"
Earth Mother, north wales,She did the same to Diana. Very much kettle & pot!
Haglet, Cheltenham,"Yes, I thought that, as well as writing to Diana. As Earth Mother says, kettle and pot. "
Admiral Hood, Portsmouth,She was a great lay.
Bright_on_coast, Brighton,Why dig this up??!!
toby40, lymington,why not ? the family are the entertainers! everybody like a slack alice character in a posh frock! It sells proved by you reading it! 
Bright_on_coast, Brighton,I dread to think what your boundaries are?!!
downthewell, anytown,There daughter and son have to read this drivel. Why can't you leave them lie in peace. I know I wouldn't want to read this about my parents
toby40, lymington,oh well never mind ! They have a choice. its well known that it was the royal bike. So why did you read it ! Every one likes a bit of drama and this family never fail to entertain the public! 
ALIA, Australia,I dont believe either of them would be reading anything on here
Annievcampbell, London,Why didnt they take away his TITLE?
Josephine Public, The Cotswolds Gloucestershire,"Because, at the time all those years ago, he was perceived to be the innocent party when she got caught out globally playing with her toy boy in Mustique. Loads knew better but it was the way the cookie crumbled."
abhjmmmjj12126, Somewhere ,"They're  both  deceased,  why bother  discussing it? "
toby40, lymington,it sells! 
MailReaderLaura, Londom,Most people would be hysterically possessive if they thought their husband wife or partner was going to cheat on them at a moments notice
Littleted01, Jackton ,What a thoroughly odious couple !
Haglet, Cheltenham,I think that they served each other right.
Wallys, Sunderland,"Margaret was not allowed to marry the man she loved very much,leading to her not having the most enjoyable of lives,everyone should be allowed to marry who they truly love,regardless of who they are "
Earth Mother, north wales,"Codswallop!  Margaret CHOSE not to marry Townsend because she would have had to give up her royal position & when push came to shove she preferred that to the man she ' loved'. SPELLA: stop believing Netflix. It's fiction. The subject of Charles marrying CPB simply never arose. At that time Camilla didn't want him. She wanted (& chose to marry) APB. Whatever Charles felt,  he was just a fling for Camilla. It didn't kick off until much later. Charles felt the pressure to produce an heir & Diana was one of the few suitable options. CPB was by then married & not available although they were having an affair & no I don't believe for a moment he loved Diana. Trouble is Diana loved him."
Haglet, Cheltenham,@ Earth Mother - very well put.
chrissp, Redhill,Had the Queen and the establishment not prevented Margaret from marrying Townsend she would have had a happy and loving marriage
Tillys, Staffordshire,"So would Charles with Camilla, worked out in the end."
Josephine Public, The Cotswolds Gloucestershire,Townsend would have bolted as well. He liked young women who were in awe of him and didn't hang around in marrying another young girl and having a second family.
Keefree, Aylesbury,She was no shrinking violet.
Admiral Hood, Portsmouth,A great lay.
Keefree, Aylesbury,"Admiral, did you miss the ""d"" out or have you some experience to share with us? Lucky you"

toby40, lymington,lol and marge the royal bike! 
Stella Estella , Out there somewhere,She was also the spare but seems very privileged and spoiled who'd want to be a royal? Especially the spare one
Dee7773, UK,"She should have been allowed to marry Townsend, he looked a decent man."
Civilian14, Liverpool,She could have married him but it would have meant giving her title up and she didn't want that. She chose royal status over him.
ALIA, Australia,There never has been a half in half out option.
Accystanman, London,You can only blame the grovelling idiots who put up with them.
SummerWoman, Dublin,Exactly. How could you value yourself so little as to put up with being treated like that.
Zulu One-Four, Koh Lipe island,Well done Harry.  Anyone who believes he was wrong to do what he's done has lost their marbles.
Angnurse, Bolton,So why can't he let go? Just buzz off and live a nice quiet life. We don't want to hear from him again- ever.
Admiral Hood, Portsmouth,Harry was the runt of the litter.

Zipp, midlands,Another royal who wasn't allowed to marry her one true love. Look at how it destroyed her .
Judistar, Countess,You mean she would have to get off her laxy backside and get a job like everyone else.
Angnurse, Bolton,If only Charles had been allowed to marry Camilla in the first place. Diana would be alive today and happily married to someone else.
dorothyea, Durham,"She was vile ,,but he was a nasty bitchy queen"
jimnyj, leeds,"The DM will now start daily articles critical of the royals.
As predicted. "
ffoiled, Eastbourne,Was he good at it!
Mary, NYC,"If he's so irrelevant, why continue to publish articles and photos of him? He certainly isn't on the front page every day in the US, or even the back page. Forget it and move on. "
Kind intent, Cambridge,"Harry, a scowling and irrelevant presence.  Perfect description Sarah.
"
Happy Swede, Malmo,"Many supporters of MM have added she would have added to the RF, but has proved her and supporters are not of a calibre for to have that position.  Its equivalent to all the adverts in the UK."
Gentian blue, xxx,I agree about the purple tabard. Made it a bit King Ralph for me.
jilly, dorset,I agree about the King's clothes at the Coronation.  Buckled shoes go with breeches NOT dress trousers.  His entire outfit looked very much pantomime.    Dogs embroidered on a Couture Coronation Dress is vulgar.  It would not have looked so awful if the embroidery was in ivory to match the fabric - I don't think our late Queen Elizabeth would have approved.    Did they really need to parade around in those crowns?  Surely the crowns could have been placed on their heads for the service and then returned to the Altar.   It all looked a bit Monty Pythonesque.
dpc999, Sliema ,This story is a real and epic tragedy that will go down in history to Harry's eternal humiliation. 
dreamygirl, Here There And Everywhere,I have great respect for Harry. 
Db B, Newcastle-under-Lyme,Good for you
Truthhurts0007, London,"Yes me too, I couldn't care less for crowd pleasers... William and wife ... Harry is brave to step out and carve his own destiny."

Old Lucy, Stoke on Trent,Will you send flowers when there is another tragedy?
Willow , London ,Great article
Osteogirl, Brighton,"Spot on article. Maturity will be eye opening, will look back with regrets."
sandy, zurich,Leave him alone
Sheba chimes, Gillingham,Brilliant 'down to earth' observations on this very mixed- up royal has- been.
Mrs Angreee, Manchester,"In a world where they could have had, and contributed so much, they are isolated and famous for being infamous. It's very sad to see they've barely moved on since 2019, despite several rebrands."
Hayhol, Eccles,"For god sake,change the record."
Vincent  Comet, Barnsley,"Can't think that Harry had a Plan A or Plan B  . Whereas find someone very rich and famous,  preferably Royalty and milk it for all it's worth was definitely the only Plan for someone."
Tonic999, Harwich,I am delighted that Americans like him because hopefully that means he will stay there.
Norris640, Peterborough,NOT INTERESTED!!! Please stop reporting on H&M as we are not interested in him or Meghan!!
GenderFree, They ....theirs,Harry is the number one royal x
J-Star-X, Exloo,"""The Duchess must have forgotten to pack the travel iron. I'm no fan of them either, but I'm less a fan of trite phrases beloved of adult men who have never got over leaving home."
FiveFive, Nowhere,If he was clever he would have aimed for a life like Zara etc have. They have a proper private life and are  still close to family and royal celebrations. 
Zac, Edinburgh,"I think a lot depends on how the children turn out, especially once they realise who they are."
ron, halifax,i have said for a long time. without the firm he is nothing. but divorced  
WhatdidIjustread, Home Counties,They want their privacy; Waaaaggh!
Katebear, Manchester,They aren't being given any privacy?
Mr Knowall, Basel,"It's what I've said for ages.  He's been through his nursery notes with the assistance of a TV actress, sold his story and given his interviews.  What does he do now?  No one is going to employ a anyone, who is incapable of keeping even basic family tittle tattle as private.  Surprisingly however, they manage to keep all her family business as private.  Strange isn't it?"
Dodgy Diesel, Crossmaglen,Harry has his Army Pension and best selling book royalties. He will never be poor.
Stella Estella , Out there somewhere,Spot on
Keith, Birkenhead,"This is the reason why Harry will never readily relinquish his titles, with all his disdain for the royal family he still clings to his titles as he is nothing without them."
Monique, London,There's a reason why people have been questioning Harry's intelligence all his life.
catherine, london,Spot on!!
davgud, Hastings,"""All his life, Harry explained, he had felt belittled by people questioning his intelligence"".................Well that certainly gonna change anytime soon!"
SoupSpoon1, Zombieland,He just wants privacy
vallee, southampton,Harrydislikes people questioning his intelligence. Doesn't he question it? He had the best money could afford in regard to education and he barely scraped an alive in art. All the options available to him and he had no known qualification apart from woke babble which is proving to be ridiculous. Oh yes and he stance on the environment which we all can see he doesn't get dye to the private flights and gas guzzling vehicles and yes abs all the bathrooms. Yes Harry your intelligence is questionable
DokterD, Btynmawr,If he had to have passed the common entrance exam to join the forces he would have failed .
bellarama, Tasmania,No matter the expense of the school if you don't get the correct help then you will suffer. He needed one on one attention and didn't get it. Everyone is capable when taught properly.
Roman-fan, Norwich,"Totally agree, couldn't have put it better myself!"
MailReaderLaura, Londom,Harry and Meghan wanted to alter the rules of being a working royal which is not acceptable to queen who rightly was aware of the money the public were paying to keep the royal family.  nicknamed the firm you have to put that into context.  If you're in a job and don't want to do the role you are assigned to and your proposition to your employer is unacceptable then you have two choices.  Take on the role or leave
Carlos.G, Manchester,And they left so what is the issue here
J Mac, Belfast,"As a very wise and loved woman whom we lost last year told him , "" You can't be half in and half out "" ."
SnootyB, Anywhere,"Like it or not, he is the King's don so is part of the royal family."
stan smith 450, Manchester,"If in the future Meghan and Harry split up, as a lot of people think will happen. She will still be the American version of royalty and will presumably keep the children. What then for Harry? Where does he go? "
PastCaring1, cardiff,he used to smile before he met Mrgan
Bird 1965, Norwich,Harry will see and understand that the Monarchy is in a very healthy place and better off for his absence
Lmglos101, Gloucester,He is still a member of the Royal Family as is all of the rest of the non 'working' royals although to be fair attending engagements etc.... can hardly be classed as having proper jobs.... cup of tea anyone ??
StarbuckBSG, DC,"No....but they basically hold up the British tourism industry by existing. Very few go to Britain for exhilarating fun. People come for history and nostalgia. They don't come for food. LOL. They don't come for fashion. They don't come to awe at industry. They come for Big Ben, the Bridge, the castles, the pubs, hoping to see dragons, to hear the accent, and the hope to run into a royal being royal."
Surreysays, Surrey,At least they still live in the UK
Shabz22, London,Let's stop writing articles about them please
Beme21, London,I love ure piece on Harry! Perfect and true.
ElseBea, Kettering,I think this is very well said and in my opinion the American Sussex bubble will burst very soon.
maxcat, Nottinghamshire,You only appreciate now what a brilliant job the Palace PR team did with him - protecting him and us from himself
Dar88, Somewhere,The money well will dry up.
Caroline Gollins, London,The royals are not that popular - at least not anymore or not much longer! Harry will always be loved worldwide and hell continue that way!
bellarama, Tasmania,Are you kidding me? Did you see the crowds at the coronation and at the Queen's funeral. I'm a Republican but hey I can see how popular the royals are.
Awakemamabear, Town called Malice,"And meanwhile his wife has elevated her celeb status from z list to b list, now joining a top celeb agency.  One would be forgiven for believing he had been used."
Denygenus, Berkshire,"Oh, how he has fallen. How does he live with himself? "
Tarquin Jollocks, Land Of Common Sense,He still is part of the Royal family. He will always be his dad's son...   
Poshpony, Surrey,"

Doesn't mean you have to like them or not be  brokenhearted by their behaviour .

"
VickyVick, Essex,Distant though!
cbreezehouse, South Manchester,Thanks for the piece  about our Euro Song  entry .. I hope we get Nil points now
Sense seeker, Marlborough,Not only has Harry gone far too far to have a way back it seems he is incapable now of behaving decently!
ang2410, edinburgh,No one cares  As long as they are not all over the media
HappeningRightNow, NearHere,"I think many Brits loved Harry because he was always that little boy who lost his mum and had to walk behind her coffin. Many of us wanted to see him grow up happy, healthy and stable. I don't think he's ever healed from that trauma and this now poisons his ability to make good decisions. It's very sad."
Maggit, Somerset,I want privacy waaaaaaaaahhhhhhh.
Christ the Tiger, Florida,He's a loser. Let's move on.
cjma, London,"Well he is popular and always will be. He was born a Prince and nobody will ever be able to change that....He is handsome, charming and a rebel - people on the whole like rebels....Diana was a rebel...she was adored by the public..."
Missing Aussie, Newcastle Melbourne,"Harry and Megs wouldn't be able to pinpoint Sussex on a map. The people of Sussex don't want them, the title was bestowed upon them by the late Queen- Unfortunately its harder to remove that it was to give! "
Pink, Dorset,"When he gets older he may look back and regret some of his decisions, what seems vitally important when you are younger changes as you get older. My concern for him is that if Meghan was no longer around just who would he have because hes burnt his bridges with his family. "
Gatsby1, London,"The world should stop giving him coverage and highly paid roles, the pair should be sent to Coventry"
Lola250589, Nowhere,"Wouldnt like to tell you this, but he is still part of the royal family its just that he is not a working royal. Still Diana and Charles son."
Kev26, London,Thanks so much for this important information which we in the UK could not have worked out for ourselves.  
guilia, Milan,Definitely agree
Ovennails, Town    ,"He looked fine to me! Didn't seem unhappy, just a little awkward."
Leemun1986, Newport,Leave him alone
Bewildered , Bracknell,"I agree, leave him alone. People love to join in with the hatred. "
Andi1969, Not the EU,As long has he stays in the USA
Hayhol, Eccles,"For god sake,give it a rest and pick on someone else."
Mcampstx, Dallas,Harry's dad is the King of England.  That makes him part of the Royal family.
Sp1derP1g, London,No pension pot? Harry is worth a reputed 40 million. His own mother left him about 15 million. He'll be fine in America with that kind of wealth.
MeganFrankie, Sydney,"Yes, but he'll have to skimp on the private jets.  Besides, the Montecito mansion reportedly costs $4 million a year to maintain."
Mongoose_, Living La Vida Loca,We don't want him back 
Captain Flack, Trumpton,Whatever they think is important is likely to be tomorrows chip paper.
WhiteMillionaire, NY State,He's still part of the royal family.  His brother may shun him but a parent's love is nearly unbreakable and redemption usually an option.
Captain Flack, Trumpton,Harry is yesterdays news on tomorrows chip paper.
vipjohnson , Columbia ,Let him live and be a dad.
Sunny2B, Edinburgh,Americans loved him because hes Dianas son and not like the rest of them. Nothing has changed there.
Emilia, Rural Yorkshire,"Americans value family, and many are disgusted at how both of them have treated their relatives. Only a few still have any regard for his mother."
VickyVick, Essex,Wrong! His rating in the US has plummeted!
Alison Aboulafia, Kfar Yona,"He could have gone to America and NOT stab his family in the back and they would still have been loved and respected by all. I think people would have been more understanding of their decision to leave. Instead, they were spiteful and decided to air their grievances in public. Who does that to their own family."
HowMuchIsEnough, Santa Monica,"Why can't people leave them alone? They chose to live their lives THEIR WAY, that should have been the end of it."
Debby1234, Atlanta,The problem becomes his constant whining about things when he lives in a mansion.  People don't want to hear how bad things are from millionaires.  Royal or not.
Dazreview, Derby,"Agree. It's like charity appeals, always fronted by someone with enough money to solve the problem themselves. "
lynzr33, Dundee,"What you don't seem to get is that he's happy. He is with the woman he loves, their two kids & they're happy. Move on for goodness sake."
State the truth, Dudley,So why does he have a permanently miserable face then if he's so happy? 
jacqui, Toronto,"They are pretty happy right now, in love, working as a team, busy as hell. Life is a blast right now."
Chrissielong, Nottingham,"They are stuck in a mansion, never go anywhere with the children, never go on holiday. At least if they were working Royals, then they would be out and about everywhere "
Karen Mirembe, vancouver,"
Chrissielong, How do you know that? Many celebs travel by private jet to places without anyone having a clue!!"
SlavaUkraine, Dubai,He and his children will always be part of the Royal family - forever.  He went to coronation because it was a big day for his father and it was the right thing to do not just to keep his name in the paper. 
Caroljane21, London,He is done over here. This weekend just shows he is not a member anyone. His titles need to be taken away now
jacqui, Toronto,Not your concern anymore!!! They are doing just fine.
Positive Outlook, Edmonton,True
jacqui, Toronto,They are doing just - not your concern anymore.
Zip379, Los angeles,Waaaaaghhhhhhh!!!! We want privacy!!!! South Park give us another episode!!!
True, Dallas,"I would assume, few read the Spare.  Because there is no way, you could read that book and feel staying in a place that makes you feel second, and worthless is better than feeling loved, wanted and special to his children, I can't understand how hard that is.  Just because your father is the King, doesn't make things right.  PH had to accept and be happy for everyone's love no matter how he felt.  Finally he finds love, and they tried to tear them apart.  KCIII got it all, and truly did not care who got hurt.  Leave PH alone, it's truly none of our business what he does with his life."
Nobodyreallyknows, Atlanta,Leave them alone!
Meme123abc, Home,"Very rude and disgusting headline. Everyone matters. If you lose interest in following someone as they go about life, so what? It doesnt mean there less valuable."
FreeSpirit , Lucerne,He is so loved. 
Ethall, Kent,By whom?
hennypenni, belfast,true colours.
tedb, melbourne,It's was funny he was alone and had no clue what to do
NeverLibNeverMaga, Westcoastisthebestcoast,"This is quote bonkers at this point. You're wrong, as usual. None of us CARE about the royal family but LOVE Harry and Meghan"
taiwan, Kaohsiung,Plan A  plan B  plan   C  plan whatever - who cares  such awful people
pictureperfect21, New York,Americans don't care about the Royals nor Harry nor Meghan.
Elizabeth, Morning Glory Circle,"Absolutely wrong.  Most of us in the US loved his mom, Diana and have felt protective of him for all these years. We are glad he is here and he is happy.  Thrilled he is away from the toxic British media, although there are still terrorizing him.  Now that the coronation is done, there is no need for him to go back there, which is what he has wanted for many years."
BlondeViking, Cornwall,Oh please... you're making me heave.
Opus1, Changed beyond recognition,"Thank you for taking one for the team. I hope you will be very happy together. Someone has to have  them, rather you than us."
eggums, Somewhere in,"Great article, Sarah! "
eggums, Somewhere in,"Great article, Sarah!"
Victoria Meldrew 28, Devon,Excellent article! She won't want him soon. He is no longer useful to her.
MileHigh, Denver,No one but the media cares one iota about this sore loser.
Drd1224, Eastlake,This woman knows nothing about Americans. We don't care about royalty. But we love Harry!!
Dazreview, Derby,Why 
rashley, Manchester,Why?
Colonel Cronus, Centre Neptune,"""The Prince wanted to include his own comeback  not because, as Moehringer explained, it added anything to the story, but because Harry thought it made him look clever"".

Well that's either untrue or completely against the whole point of the training. Having done similar exercises, the whole point is to do nothing to provoke the captors or do anything to single yourself out for 'special treatment'."
ESuttonn, Sideney,Harry remains a royal. Waity and the kids will never be royals. They are commoners.
Cedric the Saxon , Ashby,I fear for his sanity when she ditches him.
marguerite-, Columbia,"You've missed the mark. We actually do not care a dribble about the royals, Harry or any of them. Honestly, it's so odd, this obsession with royalty. It's like a soap opera that the British people have to pay for! We're American. We've had a different things going on now for a good while."
Poshpony, Surrey,"Yes Biden, and Trump, good luck ."
Etolie, Derbyshire,"Yet here you are, commenting on the royals you don't care about!"
Socalgal64, San Diego,"He's rich, happily married, and has two beautiful kids that's all that matters"
Ethall, Kent,If only that was the case.
Pandorasbox, York,This was a very well written and informative article btw. So just a heads up and well done to Sarah Vine. 
corn44, Antarctica ,He will still be Prince Harry  no matter what. Son of King Charles . That can and will never be taken from him. Live and  be happy Harry... enjoy your freedom
returntodecency, Utopia,"Even that title can actually, although it is unlikely, but make no mistake, nothing is immutable."
Pandorasbox, York,"He did indeed have once a most glittering and glamorous future, but he has sold it all, along with his soul to Netflix. A sad but true travesty. I once adored him. Now I pity him and hope amongst other things he prospers in his new life as my Queen would have wanted. I fear he will die filled with regret, never mending bridges. My Queen would have wanted him to find peace. Its sad to note he never will."
Gerty17, Gotham,He is still Prince Harry the son of King Charles so.........
Mommy of two, Birmingham,Ever so grateful for a magnificent plume and perfectly located candle! 
teaKo, Houston,"I think the whole world, not just America, want the media to shut up about them."
WhoaBessie, Jensen Beach Florida,No education and no experience soooo no.  No backup
Samantha N, London,"I think you are worrying too hard for them. His trust fund from Princess Diana is worth 35 m. Meghan had $6 million of her own from acting sad brand endorsement. Their deal with Netflix is around a $100m. Spare is a best seller.

Health insurance or security bills are not going to trouble them. If they left the UK they have to have a home, security and pay bills.  What else were they going to do but leverage their story to raise money?  Then create content and build a brand that involved media and products?"
Beaver Fenian, Beaver Creek,"Sorry, Harry. I didn't care about you whether or not you were a royal, but I bet Meghan did."
Digitdown, All cities,Oh god this is all getting very boring now....
ChicagoRoxie, Chicago,I want privacy from THEM! Whaaaagh
VRE, Plymouth,"It is America !!  We don't judge people by what family they are born to, if they are rich or poor, We judge individuals by what they stand for and what they become.  Most successful people in America came from nothing.  Harry is doing fine, I am guessing he will be a big success.  "
ReaderToo, Sydney,"We still don't know if he has any talents other than relying upon accident of birth and exploiting that. In that sense, he could well prove to be just a one-trick pony."
General Jack Ripper, Forty Seven Mile Creek,See the documentary South Park did on them for the real truth.
Pawb, Swansea,I enjoyed it. True to life.
QueenMeghanTheFirst, London,"The world cares Harry, ignore the haters. If there was a worldwide poll on whether people liked our beautiful prince and princess, harry and meghan, it would be a massive difference, the fact is, the world loves them, even if a couple of loudmouths say otherwise."
Langhorne, Whistler,"For someone who is being ""forgotten"" he sure is in the headlines a lot."
J Mac, Belfast,Many thanks to Sarah for making that observation on the ghastly tunic King CIII wore under his Ermine.  Up until now I thought I was the only one who thught it was tacky and looked cheap.
algarve, lisboa,Again?Leave the man alone.
tina, Brownsville,"Well said
"
Bababisi, Upper Marlboro,King Charles III not King Harry I.
whitey., Sydney,He has served his country and was the ambassador to Invictus. He has done many good deeds in his life so far. Let's focus on those and celebrate them.
Occasionallyamuse, Dalby,Illustrations  only
Andys rifles 2, Bristol,I served my country but I never had Three bodyguards
SirRosisOfTheLiver, London,Good article. It sums him up perfectly
Doubtfulwags, New York,Facts. And he looks so unhappy now.
Luxes, England,"You can see the regret all over his face. Pre Markle he was fun and happy. During Markle he seems sad and less of a man , she's took him over."
Brettblade, Limassol,He has more respect from me because he has distanced himself from the outdated institution when it would be so much easier to stick with them.
StuffedUpWorld, Sydney,"Harry was likeable, a real larrikin before he met Meghan."
Last Man Ranting, Medium Well Steak,Yeah can we stop this world wide privacy tour already?
Emjayy22, Dublin,Just stop writing about him. Give the guy a break
Msmcclndn, Cleveland,"I have yet to meet a single American who cares about Royals. There was zero coverage of the coronation here. We love us some Meghan, though!"
MrsC, Philadelphia,"Americans fell in love with Harry because he is Diana's son. We fell in love with him again when Diana died. We grew to respect him because he is a huge advocate for the military and vets. We watched him fall in love with an American and start a family with her...we felt proud for the man he had become.
Sadly, he has had to protect his wife from some cruel people who make money off her name every day. So, if Harry feels America is safer for him and his family, okay...we fell in love with him a long time ago and will advocate for him and his family if/when needed."
myjosiegirl, Lone Star,"I would love to know what Haz's ""snazzy"" comeback was that didn't make the book. "
Harold, Bethyname,What I don't understand is why the people who claim to hate them never shut up about them. Give it a rest! 
FLMan1982, Gatorville,Privacy please. Privacy.
Dame Cabbage, Atlanta,It's phenomenally immature to mock Prince Charles' Coronation robe. Come on S.V.: grow up.
Icecool, London,"Plan b is to live billions of inheritance he received from the Queen. Plus, whatever his dad gives him who happens to be the king. "
VictorMeldrew111, Gloucester,"Clearly then, NOW is the time to remove their royal titles. "
anonymousforever, Unknown,"Agree.  The Royal Family will survive and thrive sans Harry better and stronger.  As for his woke pool of which he is part, there are far too many and many more interesting members than him and his wife.
As for his book, it was petty and made him look pathetic.  And if he really despises the Royals, give his and family titles and live a truly private life.  Long live the real Royals, and traditional values. "
AHMED ELMI, Bellevue,Really?
RJC, Warwickshire,Netflix ordered him over to the crowning thingy ...He would not be considered a ' Valid Royal ' if he had not attended ....and that's not good box office overthere .......
faolan, Bedford,"He wouldn't have been able to attend without an invitation. Netflix Does Not decide, the King does."
Mrs Angreee, Manchester,"Faolan The point is, he was invited but vacilated whether or not to attend. He sold his birthright to Netflix. His paymasters will have made the decision for him."
mel, sarasota,Actually no. We knew of him because he belonged to the royal family. No hes known as a best selling author and most importantly as one of the creators of the Invictus games. Most people in the US are happy he left that toxic family.
Constance Crippen, northampton,"It's time Invictus dropped him, as he's tarnished their brand "
Karen Mirembe, vancouver,Well put
harry77, durham,Could the couple just be left to fade into obscurity only a question of time anyway and better I think for every one
losing_it, Derbyshire,I don't think so. They'll become relevant again once the divorce is announced!
Catladies, Coventry,"Unfortunately don't think they will, even though not working members of the Royal Family the money making model they're using has to keep them in the public eye and money is all they're interested in. It doesn't take intelligence,wit or wisdom to be an influencer just access to thousands or millions of people and they have that. It's a sad fact but they have and will make more money than anyone with genuine talent or intelligence. Just look at the book deals they got when there are writers out there struggling to make ends meet. Think of the Kardashians with no discernible talent but having plastic surgery and Photoshop. It's not a fair world."
simon25, Houston,What part of Harry wants nothing to do with the RF do people not understand?
Smug Of The Dump, Cams,Give us all the titles back then we would understand
Wotdowewant, Hampshire,Why did he come to the Coronation then?
Indysussex, London,I'm starting to feel sorry for Harry. Meghan will take the children and he will be left with nothing
chuckly bum, hello,They're happy just leave it
Jdb123, Fairview,"The monarch, KC, has custody of all minor royals in case of just such a situation."
nutterbutter, New York ,Nice article 
ALPR67, London,"The Americans care not at all about the royals, Harry or no Harry. Get up-to speed ."
katie, Birmingham,America loves our Royals. They are fascinated by them. 
Jdb123, Fairview,Are you serious? You don't speak for me or any other American. I grew up admiring the royal family and HMTQ in particular. I'm not alone in this I assure you.
Justbreathe2020, Washington DC,"You don't understand Americans at all, do you?  If you did, you would get why he's so popular."
C Lynn Marie, Somewhere,Except he's not.
HeidiSW7, London,Im American and I fully agree. 
John040465, Stockport,"Sorry Sarah, on what planet do you think he has left the family, rather than has stepped back from royal duties....?
"
Annie, Cleethorpes,"Maybe his toxic interviews, books etc.  No-one wanting to stay in a family would do what he has done."
JMM, Brisbane,"The planet of Oprah, Netflix and Spare."
Cantstomachthetruth, Geneva,He could move to a bedsit in Slough
JimmyTempura, Manchester,"He's a multi millionaire, part of the elites still."
Campari-N, Liverpool,"Yea and he'd be made most Welcome, I fear not!!!"
ExBritishMilitary, OnTheRoad,Major Jonathan Thompson is now Lieutenant Colonel
Zisee, Boston,Happy for him
Goodguys, Melbourne,Good
KTB69, The Moon,Brilliant article
MissFliss123, Glasgow,"We've been hearing ""they're finished"" for three years now.  This year alone, Harry's book was a massive success and a big agency has just signed Meghan.  They're thriving, and that infuriates you."
Bigdoll, Glasgow,"I think they have thrived because of his tell all netflix, and book series, but if he's not part of the royal family what else can he talk about "
Tonic999, Harwich,"It is great that the US likes him, as hopefully he wont come back here."
i.will say it anyway, England And Used To Be Proud ,He's gone from being liked and respected to a laughing stock lapdog. 
Efua Bombastic, London,Wrong wrong wrong!
No more bullying DK, Copenhagen,"Lots of people respect him more than before.
He chose love and freedom over privilege in an ancients institution, where he was always considered less than his brother."
Nulli Secundus, Oxford,Comedy of the decade _ Carry on Duchess 
Hadagutfull, Sydney,"He is in a pathetic state now, like Edward before him. The devaluation is beginning"
TTS_1973, Meredith,"Spot on, Sarah."
The point is, Bolton,It's Lt Cdr not Lieut Cmdr
Red Hooding Ride, Oxfordshire,Absolutely.
Abitolder, Portsmouth,"Its Lt Colonel,  hes Army not Navy,"
ExBritishMilitary, OnTheRoad,He's gone past plan Z right into the gutter.
justme, London,"Spot on, my dear!"
Mikey 2016, San Diego,There is no Plan B. This couple chose to leave the Royal family and move to California. They should be treated as ordinary folks without their Royal titles. 
We are not impressed, Harlow,"Exactly, and why was he given a police escort to Heathrow Airport.  My understanding was that he was not entitled to additional security."
Earth Mother, north wales,Absolutely
sisterjoanna, london,"He's losing his looks, his hair & his royal connections very soon there wont be anything left that is useful to me me meghan"
Jemima1, Dundee,So very true. 
Lmglos101, Gloucester,What? He's still cute and cheeky looking with a great sense of humour.
AVCE64, Victoria,"Everybody has incidents in their life where they believe they were treated poorly, spoken inaccurately about or not given credit where due but most push it aside and get on with life.  Harry keeps it all and catalogues it away for future use.  He really is a weak and characterless man."
We are not impressed, Harlow,I think he always was weak and characterless.
Tims4, Swansea,Great comment very well said. He has clearly ruminated on every negative. What a sad and rather pathetic figure.
Says-It-How-It-Is, somewhere down south,I just hope the netflix cameras will be there when it all comes crashing down around the two.....
tran, buderim,"There will be years of books and programmes to come, documenting the rise and fall of the Markles- just like the Windsors."
Ddrb, Somewhere,I hope the cameras are there to.catch William like the last photos showed.
marzz, idaho,"I am an American so I may not fully understand, but can somebody answer these questions: Why do the people of Sussex want these two representing them when all they have done is show disdain for the British people and insult the Royal family and their traditions? They have sullied the 'Sussex' name, correct? Why would the people of Sussex not insist their titles be taken away?"
No more bullying DK, Copenhagen,The good people of Wales dont want William and Kate representing them either
Theoaktree, The village,"They had a petition, but it was ignored. Democracy, eh ? "
LanaGregory, St Petersburg,Wonder what princess Diana would think of this article?
Lincolnshire Arrow, Lincoln,"She firmly believed in the monarchy, was a great supporter of Queen Elizabeth, and was proud that her son William would one day be king. She herself referred to Harry as the spare. She would have been appalled at the disrespect he showed HMTQ, Prince Philip and indeed William."
DutchBrum, Maastricht,It doesnt matter as she's been dead for 25 years. 
jimkonrad2, las vegas,I agree he is not dealing with a full deck on cards!!.
Ddrb, Somewhere,Like you would know - at least he stands up for his family.
Fraidiecat, Canterbury,"If he's so irrelevant, why does DM run so many stories about him?"
Portu Gal, Manchester,Because people like you vociferously read them
Lily, York,Good point.
phough, london,He sounds as good at reading the room as his uncle but she's got the public stirred up.
Ian Tinn, Slough,"However clever Harry's response had been, no one will ever think him clever now."
Cricketer94, Bexley,I can see cracks already.
thee, Liverpool,"Harry, we are past caring. No one likes self pity."
Christym820, Kenosha,Excellent article. Exactly right!
Peachy on East Coast, Blue Intelligentsia,That's not true...Americans were more enamored with Harry once he left that peculiar institution
Applegarth, Oxford,Unlike an American institution that has thrown up the Donald. An examlar of all American values.
Lizzie lobdob, Buckingham,"What, the family who loved,  protected and funded him for 35 years?"
RWY36R, Washington DC,"What part of America ever ""cared"" for him?"
Jemima1, Dundee,Brilliant 
Jemima1, Dundee,"OK, "
Popeyed, Edinburgh,Not really interested in reading any more stories or opinions about this guy. He is a has-been and no longer relevant. His only hope was to make a fortune in his attempt to destroy the RF. it hasnt worked so shut him up and send him away.
margo, England,That won't happen whilst people keep commenting (showing their interest)..
Irish Spirit, Sydney,Well said.
Chelle Leeds, Haiku,"Sorry, Sarah! Like most Americans, we cared about 2 little boys who tragically lost their mother BECAUSE of the Royal Family and the paparazzi. The RF means nothing to Americans."
katie, Birmingham,"They are no longer two little boys. They are grown men.William seems to be doing fine. Their mother died because she made bad decisions, not because of the Royal Family. "
katie, Birmingham,If the Royals mean nothing to you why do you go out of your way to read and comment on Royal articles in a British newspaper? I dont routinely read American newspapers or comment on your Presidents. 
expat, usa,"Leave Harry alone. After what happened to his mother, I can understand why he wants to protect his family."
Katos, Sydney,Wish people would stop using this to excuse his bad behaviour.
amazedbystupidity, Melbourne,Let's not forget Diana was duplicitous in her relationship with the press
MargaretRose, Liverpool,Tosh - now getting others to speak on their behalf - both irrelevant.
Is anyone listening, BRISTOL,"MissFliss123 - It was hardly a disaster or did you miss the crowds lining the route and over 20 million watched on TV, so certainly not a disaster."
Bobbin2, Poole,"I knew you would be from Scotland, before I even looked.  The Coronation was anything but a disaster, it was a triumph!"
Xchurchkid, Xchurch,"He is the kings son, thats a fact and itll never change."
handbag1946, Sutton Coldfied,"After what he has done, I would find it very difficult to forgive and I have experienced this with my own son.  It is heartbreaking but some things are beyong forgiveness"
Country girl 22, Somerset,And thank goodness hes way down the line of succession.
Showcasing, Tetbury,I've never seen someone give up so much for so little.
ms. no nothing, Hamilton,Edward VIII gave up everything for Wallace Simpson and they spent their live in obscurity. Forgotten. 
No more bullying DK, Copenhagen,"You imply that money and the privilege that comes as being part of the monarchy are more important than love and freedom.
I would have made the same choice as Harry any day."
Jenny Jones 27, southampton,What a fool he has been to do all this to himself he is alienated from the whole family now just about 
MissFliss123, Glasgow,"No he isn't.  Only the four senior royals, every other family member is close to Harry and Meghan."
Say it as it is NW, North West,Really? So which other senior royals are close to them?
Commnt8r, Loveland,Nobody was late. The King was early.
monica22, Flower land.,"True, besides that. What has he done? He was born with silver spoon then throw his family under the bus because his wife is not happy."
jacqui, Toronto,He has done a hell of a lot more than William!
former corpsman, San Diego,It was well-reported that he was protected from any danger in the military. However he did liken the human enemy to figures on a chess board. That was military bravery? NOT!
Justice 4 the People, London,"What has Harry got to offer?

I notice Meghane has a nrw agent..."
ekd, oakville,i hope they do well and profit from their titles as they will.That would keep the in USA
Lyttonpark, Toronto,"And what material does he have for his next books? He has nothing left to sell. But do shed light on these ""offers"" of which you speak. Dancing With the Stars?"
SailorUSVI, Somewhere,Am I the only one who thought Harry's suit wasn't tailored nicely either?  Jack Brooksbank's suit looked much nicer than Harry's.
jacqui, Toronto,Who gives a damn - it is what is in the suit that matters.
KittyCath, South Yorkshire,"I've read comments that it wasn't great, especially after Dior tweeted about it. I noticed The lapels  were poorly sewn. I believe others would have their suits from a bespoke tailor rather than a fashion house."
CMills, London,"Just as Meg has done, Harry has Burnet all bridges. Please don't come back here"
tesssa, london,He really doesn't need your invitation or permission to come to the country he was born  in.
Martin, Sydney,"Harry wouldn't even know what an iron was, let alone how to use one to press his suit."
SpringIsHere2023, Midwest,Still on Plan A. Bash the RF for cash in any way that he can.
Michael Butler, Rancho Santa Margarita,"Maybe the world has forgotten 1776? In case you did forget, let me remind you that Americans have a traditional disdain for royals/royalty/monarchy. In fact, we fought a war over it. For some reason, the media still attempts to push royals on Americans incessantly as if the royals and their relatives are relevant over here. We also don't care about royal titles either: 'No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.'"
Kiticat, Glasgow,"Favouriteaunt, the United Kingdom has been one of its strongest allies, not just England. "
Applegarth, Oxford,Yes but you have got Donald Trump and his values together with the Biden chap so you win!
GirlfromIL, Chicago,"oh honey,....take a seat and watch.....He will continue glow, so his wife..."
hol41, Dublin,Not a chance . He's nothing left to spout . Meghan will tire of him and they'll divorce . That's why there was a push to have titles for children so she's gonna try stay relevant through the kids 
jacqui, Toronto,In your dreams!  They are a great team and have lots of things on the go.
Joanne, Staten Island,I love Harry! He will always be Royal!
DONTBELIEVEMEG, Köln,"If you have children or grandchildren, would you want them to treat you the same way?"
KB Bucks, London,I have a feeling that Meghans - plan B - may not even include him. If he has lost his value he will be thrown by the wayside. Her eyes are always looking for the next opportunity.
jo, Somewhere,"Hold on for about a couple of years, and that sounds a likely outcome."
raspberrygirl, Norfolk,I agree with you. She is already limiting damages by distancing herself from his book and not kissing him back in public.
Phoenixrising287, Auckland,"Very well said, only have themselves to blame."
Realharlem, Harlem,There is a moment to let this go and maybe some news about the costs of war or a new way to freeze your vegetables.
nycexpat, The Middle,"Please do not think you are in a position to speak on behalf of America, Sarah.  Your approval means absolutely nothing at all."
Ruby, Media,"Yes, it does. From the people voting in this article she speaks for the vast majority of Americans!!"
SpringIsHere2023, Midwest,She speaks for me.
smariel, New York,He and MM have a net worth of $60 million.  Seems they'll be fine
Higher consciousness, City in the Sky,That's peanuts with their lavishly expensive lifestyle. You could pile through that in a relatively short space of time.
anetj, London,"But will they be relevant, by their net wealth?"
Massamom, Massapequa,"Royalty means nothing to Americans, absolutely nothing. "
Applegarth, Oxford,I sincerely hope not. You have your own Royals in Trump and Biden and they were voted for. God help you.
MrsS, Beeston,"Not so, many are very keen on royalty "
TheBonerPicker, Cali ,We never cared about him or her.
RabD, Glasgow,Time to give this obsession over Harry and Meghan a pass.There is more to life and things going on in the world than worrying about what Harry and Meghan are doing
kris p bacon , Burnley,Doesn't want anyone to see his pot bely
Dianaismyqueen, London,He is modern when he wants to and traditional when it pleases him. As a taxpayers that funded whole event we should be able to see everything! What is there to hide???
Jay Jay, Plymouth,"Tradition, if you can't see that then you're just as bad. We don't need to see everything. "
Dianaismyqueen, London,Tam.pax king
Pizzoff, Bristol,Lol absolutely
FLOTUS, London,Pot Kettle!
MGL, Loudoun,Probably in cahoots with Meghan and Omid.
MrPractical, brisbane,They should have tarred and feathered to mother  f   er
Famie09, Boynton beach,"What's the secret? Everyone knows he an Adulterer , haha!"
Dianaismyqueen, London,But he lost it in front of church due to William being late hahah what a spoiled br.at!
Pizzoff, Bristol,Rimmy nothing disgusting about stating facts 
Jonathan Pringle, Leeds,wonder if it was schofield as he has not been seen anytime over weekend which is strange
Brandi Lynn, Cambridge,Shameful.
FULot, Sunderland,Everyone knows you're not allowed to show the archbishop slipping his finger into the kings Charlie-hole... Shame on him and the BBC
Lisa, London,"How old are you? And how many brain cells? Not many, clearly."
Steak and kidney, Staffordshire,Nasty comment shows your level of intelligence not very bright are you
No.147, London,Name and shame him!
Hermonie, Fault Lines,Why not name the camera man?
Lizzie.D, Scotland,Good !   BBC can't be trusted these days 
David, Dunmow,Just more proof that the BBC can't be trusted as they are covering this up and not reporting when one of their own screws up!.
Baron20, US,Why the screen round him are they annointing his bottom?
ObservantOne, Heartland,"How rude, Baron. You know it's an ancient, sacred ceremony. Making such a crude remark about that speaks volumes about you."
Steak and kidney, Staffordshire,Nasty comment bet you think your funny  but your not shows your level of intelligence not bright at all
Linney1, London,"Wel done to King Charles...absolutely, terrible individual"
Rosecliff, New York,There's always that one.
JulesSY23, Ceredigion,Typical  BBC  - copying Bashir in his deceitful behaviour
Jarah_Seabass, Devonshire ,Someone needs to tell Charles that snitches get stitches. Lol. 
devonchris, London,It's the job of the BBC and any other news service to report on major events. That's a pretty massive major event. No media company should be anyone's private PR firm.
Jo-3, Homeland,"The BBC was there to film the event.
The man had an accredited spot.
The camera man will have signed a comprehensive, legally binding agreement.
He chose to break the rules.
Well done to Prince Charles for spotting him.
That cameraman won't be trusted again at any event."
Jethro Tuile, Kent,"According to the Sun , which is well known for reliable reporting."
Marx, Bucks,Tarry from Cardiff: maybe Charlie was having his incontinent pad changed or does he become a sanitary towel?
Rimmy, Toronto,Why are you living in the UK?
Dianaismyqueen, London,Or he wanted to be Tam.pax
GrandPrix, Patomac,It would be interesting to know what DM would have paid for the video....
Yorkshire lady, Proudly up North,"Just a random thought. If countries leave the Commonwealth, does their leaf get cancelled I wonder? Or stay as a memorial to the day? "
MadJ, Newcastle,Well that's the last job that cameraman will get
ABOVE THE LAW, ON YOUR SCREEN,That reminds me what was so secretive... Random I know!
Rimmy, Toronto,You might call yourself above the law but you are below the mud when it comes to your thinking abilities
linda mcavoy, Kent,Only the BBC about time we stopped having to pay for the licence 
HarrySnapperOrgans, Q Division ,Is the needle stuck again dear ? 
Marx, Bucks,This was obviously Charles' attempt at a Paul Danials trick but it ended inevitably like Tommy Cooper.
Marx, Bucks,Don't worry Charlie we don't want to see you pee into the royal pee  goblet.
conwycrown, Cardiff,Time for your nappy change? 
MadJ, Newcastle,They let you out for the day weirdo
reasonable person, Hastings,"Everything annoys Charlie.  A leaking pen.  Having to wait  4 minutes after arriving too early at the Abbey.  What a petulant little man.  The Cameraman was probably checking his e-mails.  The last thing I want to see is a shaky, elderly man being anointed with olive oil brought from Jerusalem at the taxpayers' expense."
Baron20, US,Servants wipe his bottom
Dianaismyqueen, London,He waited to long for throne and he is too old and spoiled mummys boy that loses nerves easily it was not easy for Diana with his tantrums
Bikerz, Oakingham,"The Churchy boys and girls deliberately want to keep this to themselves to elevate themselves above ordinary people. Yet Jesus dying on the cross was a very public thing apparently. So, if God was prepared to have his son die in public, why can't the people see a King being annointed in public?"
reasonable person, Hastings,"Shaking.  Charlie  does not regret his adulterous liaison with the married Camilla, mother or 2.  This is why he had her made queen."
Dianaismyqueen, London,Charlie wanted privacy so he could screw us around and we paid for all this
reasonable person, Hastings,The BBC cameraman was probably bored by the unending pantomime.  He was checking e-mails from his girlfriend.  Who on earth would want to watch a 74 year old have parts of his anatomy smeared with olive oil? 
Paul, England,Good on Charlie .
Milly Gilly, Southampton,"The screen had three panels, not four."
Dianaismyqueen, London,So Camilla was watching
Ash07 West Midlands, West Midlands,other GAF was not recording the Windsor Castle event to the end stopping it short of filming and recording the final act is another insult to the Monarch and the public who pay the license fee for this poor service they should be ashamed of themselves 
lesterone, Leicester,"I can choose if l subscribe to any other broadcaster, sky, virgin etc, but am forced to subscribe to bbc, why ???, make it subscription only, let's see how many people would choose to pay for it "
The Realist, London,#DefundTheBBC
PeteJS, Shropshire,And today's DM anti-BBC dog-whistle is...
PeteJS, Shropshire,"No - never worked for them, and fully retired thanks. Take your silly fantasies elsewhere -but don't believe the rubbish the DM prints... "
Elon Gate, Springfields,PSeudo Realist... The Majority?
June19, Poole,"Do we the taxpayer, who funded this have a price of how much this cost yet?"
mydaywillcome, WindsorCastle,"BTHB
You are so gullible this figure was touted about by the Tories. You are being conned!"
Dianaismyqueen, London,we should be able to watch as taxpayers
EdwynTheGay, Mouse Island,Why is the annoitment done off camera? Did they annoint his privates or something??
linda mcavoy, Kent,Don't be so ignorant 
mydaywillcome, WindsorCastle,Yes!
MajorTim, England,Disrepect from the BBC? Hardly a surprise is it?
UnJonzy, London,"Ooo, I know, it's outrageous. Imagine. Trying to film a man having olive oil sprinkled on his head. Dreadful."
BeadyEyed, A Mud Hut,"Ooooo Un, you obviously have no sense of historical significance when a king or queen is crowned. Why not study the history of the country you live in? Tool!"
davenants, Southampton,"haha, it was probably martin bashir."
DLL999, Saintes,Kate Adie tried to get a unique view of Gorbatchev when he arrived at RAF Brize Norton to meet Maggie in the late 80s. She sneaked away from the Press Area and headed for a roof to get a scoop. She was almost shot by security and brought back to her authorised zone. Journalists are NOT to be trusted. They think they are allowed to break the rules. They are stupid!
mancunian, Oswestry,You have to hand it to mailonline writers:  they come up with some wonderful words:  anointment and last week it was coronated.
green, London,typical bbc
Wendy291, Paris,Do you know what frogmarched means DM? I doubt they did that!
Robo-Dad, Mega-Village-One,Stewart Carr - just another DM Drama Queen.

Folkie, Somewhere,"In some countries and religions the elderly are revered and treated with respect,"
linda mcavoy, Kent,I'd like you to work as hard as they do if you don't like our tradition go live in Russia you would fit in there
linda mcavoy, Kent,I e been reading your posts you are one nasty person I bet you have zero friends
Nellie14, Outernowear,"All they do is touch his head, and chest."
Aristotle, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh,"That anointing lark, how do they all keep straight faces?"
Diamonddeluxe, The North,"Unlike you, they are intelligent adults not puerile imbeciles.  "
MotleyCrew, Middle England,I bet that screen was to allow a 'comfort break' for an old man who's just had to sit around for ages after being jiggled about in a pompous carriage. The thing about coronations is ... they're a bit like busses.
conwycrown, Cardiff,Motley. Thats some persecution complex you have. Help is available. 
MotleyCrew, Middle England,"All those anti-vaxxers crying freedom - but, now, Charles just arrests all those that want to put a dint in his big day - and we just take it. Nope, that's our look-out - and Charles dished it out."
Mark John Two, Republic Town,Do you know who I am...??
Tom_Foch, Chester,"Pouring olive oil over two adulterers is not sacred, even if you do it in a church."
conwycrown, Cardiff,Tom F.  Youre such a saint. Not. 
JoshRipley, Metropolis,Typical BBC behaviour.
weeman22, Port Glasgow,Why the screen where the hell was he getting anointed 
Daemon666, Southampton,Do try to keep up with the adults.
TheUnbeliever, Bromsgrove,Secret where he swears allegiance to the WEF and WHO?
Tenya, Birmingham,How completely ridiculous!!! Secret anointing !!! Ha ha ha!!! We they doing some witchcraft?
Mensa International, Caythorpe,"@Angel, if you're so worried about christian kindness, why do half your comments contain insults aimed at people who don't share your political beliefs?"
Darwin85, Sunny Tunny Wells,The really good news Fraisy is that christianity is fast approaching cult status in the UK as their old victims die off & the next generation rightly ignore them. Check out our latest census results to see that those of us with no religion are fast becoming the majority. All the anointing nonsense in the coronation will only help our young people laugh religion into history.
Skepticatt, Devon,Why should any part of the ceremony have been hidden from the public?
Cubpaws, London,Daemon666: but not the bit we he swears to uphold the teachings of the Church of England. God plainly asleep on the job when that little gem got spat out right ?
Mensa International, Caythorpe,"@Daemon, if it's between the king and god then Charles should have applied his own oil behind the screen rather than being rubbed by two other blokes."
Knot Hardly, Boca Raton,Is he now in the Tower?
Danny Darko, London,"Typical lefty behaviour , that they feel entitled  to know another's secrets

Envy is the lefties problem  , hence why most of them speak with pure bitterness  within their words

Keep away from sucking lemons "
Archimedes Polonium, Holby,That was no gaffe. It was deliberate.
Tenya, Birmingham,Jolly good!
ManchesterRob, Manchester,'Sacred' indeed! What a load of baloney. Nothing more than a ridiculous ceremony that is designed to show superiority to the feeble-minded. Having some oil drizzled over him like a lettuce will have the same effect as all the homeopathic nonsense that he so strongly advocates. None.
Darwin85, Sunny Tunny Wells,"Careful Angel, doesnt your big christian book of nonsense demand that women dont speak up like this? (1 Timmy 2:12) Plus you must NEVER question any men!
If you ignore the big book & dont do as men demand then youll be cast into the fires of hell for eternity & you probably wouldnt want that."
ManchesterRob, Manchester,"1) I'm not a lefty, nowhere NEAR!
2) The royal family is the epitome of an undemocratic organisation. It has no place in the 21st century. Clearly to some (weak-minding) individuals, a bit of mindless pomp and ceremony is more than enough to offset the gross abuses of our system. For example - no death duties required after the queen died, Charlie just kept all his millions to yourself. It's obscene, and you're clearly happy with that."
Marbellina, Bristol,This occurred on the day too. The camera briefly focused on the gap between the screens. It should have been planned just to film the congregation /choir/ decorations etc. 
Tenya, Birmingham,All of it is just a silly kids play!!
Cubpaws, London,"Angel of heaven: kindness of Christianity ? Did you tap that out with a straight face ? The CoE, claiming with a straight face they are the true followers of Jesus, sit on a wealth pile of almost 9 billion and entirely ignore their claimed leader Jesus instruction to give their material resources to the poor. Oh but they'd wring their hands and convince themselves, like the man they anointed, some bits of Christianity are just too pesky awkward to be bothered with. Go figure Sherlock"
Disgusted of Ely, Ely,Why is this man's identity being protected? Shades of Rolf and Jimmy.
mclarek, NY,Lol
Archimedes Polonium, Holby,"I suspect that he is from a box ticking category, not familiar with the culture."

Seltzer, Preston,Petulant Charlie
Seroiusly, Hartlepool,"""Has"" him thrown out (headline).  ""Alledgedly"" has him thrown out (byline) Which is it DM?"
Lampshade51, UK airspace,"""Hierarcy of truth"" runs from the top of the article to the bottom of it. You are more likely to find actual facts at the end."
Tenya, Birmingham,That's the DM style.
SMASH DOWN FASTER, DAVOS SWITZERLAND,"What was being covered up,  apart from Charles?"
Sunny2624, Stuttgart,His Majesty was absolutely right doing so. I can't believe this reporter really even tried to film this moment.
Tenya, Birmingham,"Whose majesty? Are you telling us a fairy tale? Wake up, you're dreaming... Charlie's a ceremonial king only! He does nothing apart from trying to grab more land for his family. But he'll have to give it all back!!"
BeadyEyed, A Mud Hut,"Tenya, you could go back to your own neck of the woods if you dont like what is happening in the UK?"
Maskirovka, Devon,"A lot of haters out today - who would I trust most, the King or the BBC, - no contest."

Tenya, Birmingham,"Who, Charlie? Yes!!"
matt 111, GB,Name him the BBC chap should never  work again in media 
Disgusted of Ely, Ely,Yes. Why protect his identity?
David Bachauer, Manchester UK,The truth is that in rehearsals the holy oil is not used and it would be embarrassing for the public to know that 'crisp and dry' is substituted.
Pete, Out In The Hills,Actually it was a spoonful of used oil from the chippy down the street.
bellybuttonfluff, Southampton,"Charles is a WEF puppet, he won't have your best interests at heart and if you have no idea what I'm on about the you're part of the problem and you need to wise up asap!"
Foxyfrox, Yorkshire,Don't like Our system?  Go elsewhere.
james, tunbridge wells,"It's just to make it more interesting and privileged  to give the gawpers some proper gawping but without the satisfaction of having gawped....there's is no exclusivity without  the  exclusion of others, but why do any of it in public anyway -- the biggest secret is there is no secret., it's just exclusion of others."
Aristotle, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh,"I can hardly believe that grown-ups are even discussing whether a medieval, loonie ritual should be secret or not. Whoops, Im discussing it, sort of."
Tenya, Birmingham,All of this should be scrapped!!! It was an expensive children play!! Finish with it! This was the last time!!!!
BeadyEyed, A Mud Hut,"Someone needs to donate some funds for Tenya to go somewhere else to live, ill chip in a dollar for you!"
Mirrin, GREENOCK,Ridiculous procedure what has christianity to do with all that pomp and wealth nothing holy about it
WillBucks, Bucks,Not allowed to film secret handshakes particularly when the archbishop has his hand on Charles' orb and the King has his hand on the archbishops rod. 
Pete, Out In The Hills,LOL
Tenya, Birmingham,Ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!
Berstein, HereandNow,Get the BBC thrown out of all events next time not just the cameramen.
Mamabear, Up North,"We are paying for it, for them..there should be no secret rituals.."
Tenya, Birmingham,"Better, scrap this si lly event forever!"
Surfer bird, Birmingham,What do you expect
SocialistAtSeventy, Bristol,Shameful BBC filming inside a men's changing room!
Crumbs Everywhere, London,The absolute ridiculousness of it all! Delighted it had such a low turnout.
JMM, Brisbane,"Err,  did you close your eyes so as not to  observe the huge crowds?"
Liamtoh, London,Low turnout? Did you not see the huge crowds? 
Aristotle, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh,Ha Ha Ha So dabbing extra virgin on parts of Chas body is a state secret. Ha Ha Ha.
Aristotle, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh,"Sorry, State secret, rather"
puddytatt, sheffield,Idiot
wonder why, London,You'd think they picked who attend these event to represent the BBC honourably..but n. They pick a disrespectful lowlife.
Stromboli, Poole,"I did notice that there was a fixed camera view located high up in the vaulting, looking vertically down on the anointing chair.  This camera would've seen and possibly recorded the anointing ceremony itself.  "
BibliophileUK, Plymouth,"But it didn't otherwise the BBC would have wasted no time showing off the footage. Since they didn't, your alleged recording didn't occur either. "
Keefree, Aylesbury,"""Secret""!? What a farce. Carry on chuck"
Danny Darko, London,"The left hate historical monarchy  traditions  of secrecy

Hence the bbc sticking  their Pinocchio  noses in when it shouldn't be "
Aristotle, Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh,"No, not the left, most normal people."
Danny Darko, London,"You mean nosey people  who want to know everything that has nothing to do with them

Mostly  lefties , don't tar the whole country  as that mate , look in the mirror instead "
Jonty, Wakefield ,I know I'm sorry it's rather disrespectful but every time I see a picture of Camilla with the crown perched on her head it's so amusing just cant help a laugh.....She looks so ridiculous....Would have been far more dignified to have her there without being crowned.....
Mamabear, Up North,It's a disgrace that thing is queen
I am alright Jack, Aisle Of Plenty,The whole thing is like game of thrones or LOTR
puddytatt, sheffield,Don't be ridiculous
Notsoyummy, Hull,Why was it so secretive? Where were they anointing him?
Scotsman243, Edinburgh,"The palms, the chest and the forehead.  Are you suggesting we ditch changing cubicles in swimming pools? Have a bit of respect. Shows how scummy the BBC is to ge a tabloid scoop in the changing rooms."
Didimumisit, Blackpool,Paid by Hasbeen and Meagain to get footage for their next Netflix series 
Kamikaze pigeon, Gods country,Now that wouldn't surprise me
frames, London,"Given that the whole thing looked like an am-dram production (Cheltenham Little Theatre) of Murder in the Cathdral, it's no surprise that that the lead actor threw a hissy fit."
Us, In the UK,Was he arrested?
Whelking, Brighton,Medieval mumbo jumbo
XYXZ, London,Some sa tan ic rituals.
BibliophileUK, Plymouth,Satan doesn't exist except in the imaginations of deluded idiots like you!!!
XYXZ, London,It sure exists for them!
theviking., Berwick Upon Tweed,Thought he would make money on the side!
CrazyOneOhOne, Birmingham,This doesn't surprise me in the slightest. The BBC seem to hate England and our traditions and values.
Estel, Oxford,Should have barred all the bbc.
Lizzie, London,Probably moonlighting for Netflix 
Forlorn Hope, London,The BBC's arrogance and left-wing bias knows no bounds.
CrazyOneOhOne, Birmingham,Indeed. Sickening.
Dorsetwolf, Bournemouth,Is this really 2023? Hard to believe reading this nonsense.
CharlieGeorgeAgain, Pembroke,"Clearly, you have major trouble understanding that tradition and a thoroughness in adhering to set practices and situations such as this is what marks this country out from the rest of the world.

It's what makes Britain's royal family, THE royal family, when anyone around the globe is talking about royalty and the monarchy.

You just don't get it. And that's fine.

Just don't whine when the majority DO get it."
David Bachauer, Manchester UK,Agree -experience and reason should be the guide- the ritual is absurd and tradition  is a wretched argument for anything.
Dutchie of Dorset, Bournemouth,BBC employee ... now why doesnt that surprise me . I am glad he got removed. Now go a step further and remove BBC out of our lives too!  They are so anti UK at any opportunity . Disgusting firm.
CrazyOneOhOne, Birmingham,Well said
Joho v, Southend,I think it was the most blasphemous part. Holy oil my right foot. 
CrazyOneOhOne, Birmingham,"It's been blessed, hence 'holy'. Not really that hard to understand."

Bright_on_coast, Brighton,Not that secret as God's watching!!

Yes, indeed 21st Century, so ruddy well learn from the past and stop this nonsense that you speak of or are you imaginary too?!! Methinks YES!!"
A Trusting Soul, Stour by the Sea,There will always be some journalist trying to get a scoop no matter what occasion 
CarrieGrant, London,Typical BBC!
Animalmag, Battersea,It's there incase it initially falls off
Krakenish, Berwickshire,What falls off? The screen is to obscure the ceremony in which the monarch has oil placed on him in several places by the archbishop.
Saveloy, London,Nasty BBC.
Dr Eamer, Essex,Familiarity breeds contempt.
carl2911, Taipei ,Why so secretive about it ? 
ParaJack, Chester,"I would tell you, but it's a secret."
carl2911, Taipei ,@ parajack .....tease ...lol 
Moogabee, Cardiff,"At the very least the head of BBC should personally call the palace immediately to apologise but as usual, his silent 'wait n see' attitude hoping it will all go away shows how weak and spineless he is. "

I pace, cambridgeshire,Does he think he's some kind of deity!
Jan Spencer, Marlborough,Annoiting the king goes back thousands of years and is a world wide custom
Seldom published, Belfast,"I am surprised the Royal Family give the BBC any access at all given its track record, the Princess Diana interview comes to mind."
MysteryMike, Salisbury,The Royal Family's own track record isn't something to be proud of.

Saveloy, London,If you don't know that there's no hope.
silent voices, somewhere,It's called tradition. Of which we have precious little left in this country.
HotVoice, Kent,Its tradition that the oiling up is done behind a screen.

BibliophileUK, Plymouth,Licence.

Saveloy, London,You can't spell properly.
Kingwithbagsofcash, Bootlickers close,Can you stand up by yourself 
Colin.B, Guildford,If the BBC don't sack the cameraman it will show they are complicit in his attempt to record this part of the ceremony.
greycoat80, England,The sacred anointing lol can't believe I'm reading about such rubbish in 2023

Jane, U.K.,Good now for a complete overhaul of The British Biased Corporation  with it immediately defunded  with this journalist fired without any severance
Erehwon, Maidstone,Nothing the BBC does these days appears to be an accident.

Manilva, newcastle upon tyne,"Probably another Lefty, Woke enthusiast from the BBC. Surreptitiously take footage on his mobile then post it on social media and mock the pomp and pageantry. They're all sooooo predictable! Pleased he was spotted. "
Nebuchadnezza, Northerner down south,Where is the BBC outrage??. Is this true??. Why aren't the BBC APOLOGISING??. They're quick to jump on other professions aren't they??. Utter joke!!.

Safe Haven, London,"The public paid for all this, so I dont see why we dont get to see the whole show"
BibliophileUK, Plymouth,You clearly DON'T understand the tradition then.
JohnyM, London,So they use olive oil then...
MinionBob, Suffolk,"Extra virgin, that would be ironic"
Pete, Out In The Hills,They could just get some used oil from the chippy down the road.
Pete, Out In The Hills,"It's all a bit mumbo-jumbo, eh?  I'm neutral on the royals because it won't make a speck of difference to my life whether they're just rich folk or rich folk with crowns but enjoyed the coronation schtick on TV because it was good showbiz and a tour-de-force from the logistics and technical angles."
Commonsence Norfolk, Kings lynn,"That moment isnt all about the oil, it a moment between the man and his God, so good for Charles, but I bet the BBC take no action with the individual even thought he was representing them."
Tracey99N, Poole,Some stupid comments by people who don't read further than the first paragraph. They were practicing the coronation & a BBC staff member tried to record footage on a mobile obviously to sell to the media before the actual coronation. Abuse of trust. Fire him.
N. Le G, Daventry ,"What else do you expect from the disrespectful BBC, where the first B stands for anything except British!"
AprilTruscottSmart, Buckinghamshire,What a disgraceful act by a privileged photographer. Imagine the money he could have made from selling photos if he had succeeded. If the people involved wanted to keep part of the ceremony private they had every right to do so. 
Tezack, Rotherham,Supped Phil and holly wernt behind the screens

Utterlyfrank, Southampton,The Daily Mirror comments must be very slim today. They've sent their best here. You can tell by the low quality of their uneducated comments.
Utterlyfrank, Southampton,I see you're from Birmingham..... oh I am sorry. That must be quite a load to carry!
Utterlyfrank, Southampton,I'm not sure anything is going to rub off on you... and I know why.... and you don't.
Mydonose, Amsterdam,Good for Charles. No one would like to see him naked or whatever.
Tulsa2406, Stoke on Trent,No one would see him naked -idiot
boris.johnson, London,Lol something very smutty about that whole thing
expat, auckland,His coronation his rules just where is the problem.
MysteryMike, Salisbury,"We paid for it, so technically it's OUR coronation."
expat, auckland,So if a father paid for a wedding he would have full control over all the wedding ...I don't think  so..
memyself, Southampton,And Camilla appears after they take the screens away.
Mensa International, Caythorpe,This ceremony would have been a lot more private had he not invited camera crews to film it.
Personalive, LEIGH-ON-SEA,You mean like his Mothers?
Brexit bonus, Gammon Roll,"Amazing that old sausage fingers was the only person who spotted this, more likely that he has taken a dislike to someone, another pen moment or just perhaps the colour of their skin.  "
Kefala, Voula,behind a screen anointed with Holy Oil...my blood is boiling and the words I want to write would get me banned for life by the DM....
Personalive, LEIGH-ON-SEA,"Oh dear! and not even anything to do with you or your Country if you really do live there?


Country if you really do live there?"
MysteryMike, Salisbury,Why is it so private? Do they anoint his John Thomas? Could do with some of those screens on the beach. Would look quite spiffy.

lisa, newcastle upon tyne,So many disrespectful comments on here  today
MrMuckle, Birmingham,Our King's support for the agenda of The World Economic Forum is disrespectful to those he considers his subjects.  
Cambs 2022, Cambridge,"How very religious, anointed before God - having himself broken one of his commandments as an adulterer."
Quentin5, Maha Sarakham,"Mother, put that stone down."
MrMuckle, Birmingham,"His support for the agenda of The World Economic Forum won't go down well with The Lord, either. "
ErnestNowell, Goole,"Dear oh dear, the sad and Republicans out in force today."
General Desborough, Republic of Great Britain,"Dear oh dear, the sad bootlickers and  hem sniffers are out in force today."
MrMuckle, Birmingham,"Why would you fawn all over a king who supports the agenda of The World Economic Forum?

God bless America and its patriots.  "
Buzzsawww, Republic of Scotland,"The worst part is to turn members of the armed forces into servants, heads bowed, and holding Chucks modesty screen.

General Desborough, Republic of Great Britain,"I think Utterlyfrank is another of Jimmy's nom de plumes, there surely can't be two grovelling apologists for monarchy on these pages."
uktinkabell, Somewhere,There are some very sick people on this site again today.
Personalive, LEIGH-ON-SEA,And very thick as well!
MrMuckle, Birmingham,Our king supporting the agenda of The World Economic Forum is the sickest thing of all. 
bootsyjam, london,There should be NO secrecy in this. None
Utterlyfrank, Southampton,You just don't Get It do you!!!! Oh the education in the comprehensive battery Schools of this country is Soooooo lacking! Brainwashing by the Left!
Personalive, LEIGH-ON-SEA,Thick brick!
TVOReason, Middlesbrough,"Another disrespectful BBC employee, sack him"
Utterlyfrank, Southampton,The whole left wing BBC should be replaced.
trevorsmith, limbo,Must be the bit where they put an old teaspoon up the bottom. Kate found that bit hilarious.

Beyond the Sea, Land of Nod,Without reading I would have known it was the BBC.
asgoodasitgets25, London,So what is the secret part? Trousers down?
jo jojo, chester,"He  had  to  remove  his  shirt   as   the oil is  rubbed  on  his  chest,   does  anyone  know  if  this  ceremony  was  part  of  the late  queens  coronation"
Shopper100, Derby,"Yes it was, don't know if it's always been the case"
thank_you_china, Somewhere,Poor guy gets the sack for filming Charles putting on his Halloween costume? Bit ridiculous.
Lars Gonaards, The Collapsing Empire,"The daub the Royal Jewels in time honoured tradition, only this time it's with an olive oil blend"
charlotte, leeds,The BBC are disgusting
Lars Gonaards, The Collapsing Empire,"Are we to believe it's gods will or just a bloke whose family managed to steal, plunder and kill better than others?"
pam1696, chester,"Of course it was a BBC reporter, enough said..."
WellColourMeHappy, An island,Trust BBC always think theyre above everything and everyone.
Philosphical Me, Watford,More DM hypocrisy.  There is nothing secret about the anointing - it is a key part of the ceremony.  However the King had every right to receive it in private.  Does this mean DM is now going to champion His Majesty's Privacy World Tour because it hates the BBC?  Of course not.
Bathsheba89, Haverfordwest,No no no. There is more to this believe me.
Crochetcrafter, Colchester,"Yes , yes,  it's called money..."
Lars Gonaards, The Collapsing Empire,They daub his grapes with oil....
Aghastatignorance, Washington,That's the Pope you're thinking of.
puddytatt, sheffield,You're childish.
Lars Gonaards, The Collapsing Empire,Dabbing a bit of olive oil on his grapes... true
Arisiles, UK,That sounds just like the church! Lets play with mens.... then pretend its a sin!
birds eye, Reading,King Charles not giving the BBC a Diana moment not the first time the organisation has introduced on the RF.
Lars Gonaards, The Collapsing Empire,The anointing is where the dab a bit of olive on his billiard balls
Tulsa2406, Stoke on Trent,"No they don't, moron - head breast and hands"
chale, Bournemouth,What a ridiculous  tradition. Why is it so sacred?
Evidence, Barnsley,"It's sacrilegious if anything, for believers."
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,The DM has a BBC fetish
Nick, Soton,"Vegan - I don't think anyone despises anything - except ignorance and stupidity. What bothers folk about the BBC is that it has a clear mandate, the funding, the range, the resources to produce first class truly honest programming. Instead it chooses biased, Left wing, big state socialist tripe. It's lies, deceit and propaganda are endless. Worse, because of the historical value it had, people continue to believe trust it and those lies become accepted. "
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,"I have got no strong views on the BBC one way or the other, but I am baffled as to why the DM is so obsessed with it.  Mind you, I despise the DM but I keep looking at it."
Smallgreenbouncyone, here,That part of the ceremony is supposed to be PRIVATE - just Welby and Charles - and NO-ONE ELSE!!!!!!
Shopper100, Derby,"Don't know whether this has always happened,  but certainly it happened at Queen Elizabeth's coronation, so presumably it's always been like that not just something Charles wanted "
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,They were practicing the secret handshake 
Teejam140, London,"The anointment is a very private and spiritual part of the ceremony, especially so for King Charles who believes in God, That man trying film the moment is comparable to a journalist spying on someone in confession with their priest in church. Totally despicable behaviour, youd expect that from a tabloid jounalist but not a representative of the BBC"
Evidence, Barnsley,So god was anointing him with special powers? Just him. 
made in uk, blackburn,"Behind the screen ??  Holy oils lol.
Our and agremnt with him down stairs??"
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,Furious King slams the BBC
Lightanddark1111, Pleadian,I feel this where he shape shifts back into a reptilian for his anointing 
Smallgreenbouncyone, here,Bore off!
ODan2022, Osaka,I needed a laugh.
ANDY, LONDON,"Another day, another bashing of the BBC by the DM. Funny the DM was gunning for the BBC over the weekend for covering the Anti monarchy protesters, but the police have now apologised, wonder if the DM will and whets the article on the police apology?"
Ibowtonobody, Up north ,And Lee Anderson 
EmmaHarris, North,"Charles is a miserable person, prone to temper displays and used to getting his own way."
Arisiles, UK,Think you would be a bit upset if some was filming you at what you feel is private moment
EmmaHarris, North,It is well documented and seen live on tv that he has a short temper fuse. Neither is it a good thing for the country and himself if he is fawned over from birth when in fact he is quite mediocre.
Siobhancarlie, Bramhall,Wow! Isnt it amazing that the only one to spot the cameraman lurking around was Charles!! It is a strange ceremony to me to have the King hidden from everybody but these rituals have strange reasonings and the cameraman probably wanted to be the one to know what really happens behind the screen. Such a shame he is out on his ear now.
Aghastatignorance, Washington,Charles was the only one facing that direction.
Siobhancarlie, Bramhall,"That makes sense aghast, and lucky Charles was facing that way. The bloke is probably kicking himself for being so stupid."
Personalive, LEIGH-ON-SEA,"Good for Charles , always has to be one creep trying to get a private photo, or record a private moment.
All mobile phones should have been taken away from the people who were there to record it for TV !
People in the BBC think they can say and do as they please!"
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,Its lucky the DM never do that
Lolly310, Hampshire,More speculative nonsense from well placed 'sources'. Same as the article on H and did he didn't he pop in to the palace.
Rekt-AF_, Hertfordshire,"Sentence him 60 days on The Rack, then, 50 years in an Iron Maiden. Jobs a gooden. "
The Great McGonagall, Leeds,"What on earth are 2 rock bands going to do, deafen him or play him to death"
soniad, Nottingham,"BBC presenter yesterday said she thought the Coronation was a waste of money. Despite an eminent financial expert explaining the huge benefits to the country, she persisted. I never usually watch BBC news, it was a mistake. Defund them!"
Ibowtonobody, Up north ,There are more tourists visiting French palaces than British ones and they got rid of the BBC centuries ago. Go figure.
Ibowtonobody, Up north ,*the monarchy not the BBC 
BeckyBecks, London,"Is this report true? How come Charles is the one who noticed and nobody else? Why would a BBC cameraman be so unprofessional? If true, then he has a right to be sacked. "
Aghastatignorance, Washington,He was the only one facing that direction.
angus mccoatup, Manchester,"The cameraman knew what he was doing wasn't allowed, otherwise he wouldn't have been sneaking around and acting shiftily. No doubt, he intended to sell this footage on for personal profit. Having his accreditation torn up on the spot should be the least punishment that he suffers."
Ibowtonobody, Up north ,ALLEGEDLY!!!
Itsonlyme-UK, Hometown,"Thrown out of the Abbey?
Surely the Tower would have been the appropriate destination for this unclean peasant?"
Ibowtonobody, Up north ,What doing the tourist tour.

Peter c, Hertford,"Make sure it's olive oil, much better finish. "
Melrose12, London,"Entitled peasants who think they can do what they like. I am surprised mobiles were not banned, people just cannot be trusted when they think they can make some money."
Moretodo, St Helier,"The BBC has form for poor behaviour,  should be renamed the Dodgy Broadcasting Service as they are becoming an embarrassment to Britain."
JennyLind, Narnia,This so called secret part of the ceremony is intimate because it has always been done on bare skin. 
Siobhancarlie, Bramhall,Ahhh so Charles got undressed! I see now! 
Glitz, in england,I am cancelling my TV licence today. I never watch BBC and it is no longer fit for purpose. 
Joeseph Bloggs , Newcastle,"Once you cancel it remember to apply for a refund (its not automatic) and you will get a whole year back as most paid upfront, plus you will get a part refund from this year too."
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,"I am furious with the BBC, I am going to slam it"
MissFliss123, Glasgow,"Surrounded by security, and nobody but Charles noticed the man?  "
Everton 1, Liverpool O,BBC......again. 
Michelle21, Wordsley,What do you mean 'again'? please elaborate.
NZBobby, Mansfield,Stop the Mumbo Jumbo!... It's time for a republic!
Personalive, LEIGH-ON-SEA,"Yes keep banging on about a Republic, but what are you doing to get one , apart from.standing around with your little not my king banners, all talk and no action! "
Personalive, LEIGH-ON-SEA,Grow up  and go back to mummy and daddy 
Peachy on East Coast, Blue Intelligentsia,These comments are akin to the mindless devotion Trumpers spew

Doctor Ash Tre, Los Angeles,I'm living here in my trailer and by God I'm sick of these people with their fancy talk and schooling. I fully support King Charles as he were anointed by the almighty himself and ain't that a fact.

FredaPash, London,I wonder how much those ridiculous panels cost for that ridiculously stupid part of the ceremony
Laz62, Plymouth,"What else would you expect from the BBC.
"
Warriewood, Hapton,Why cannot people do as they have been asked.
BRExit FAIL, Sunningdale,"Intimate? It used to be civit oil, I won't say how it was extruded from the animal here but as Charles is woke wanted a vegan version so he was smeared in olive oil "
Personalive, LEIGH-ON-SEA,I am never confused!
BRExit FAIL, Sunningdale,Just a lying stooge then?
Lindy95, Oxford,What utter tosh
FredaPash, London,It was an utterly ridiculous part of the ceremony.
Slushypup, Cornwall,"So is putting mince pies out for Father Christmas, but it's tradition!"
BRExit FAIL, Sunningdale,"Mr pup, that's a tradition we got from Germany in the late 19th century thanks to prince Albert "
captains log, manchester,"You'd never get the DM doing that kind of thing.....according to their lip readers , sources and telecom researchers"
Everton 1, Liverpool O,Telecom researchers.....I laughed.
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,(cough) hacking (cough)
Northern neutral, Manchester,Is there really any actual difference between olive oil from Jerusalem and olive oil from a shop .....
Harlyn70, Feath,Where do you think the olive oil in the shop comes from?
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,Margarine would have done.
Naomi Cox, York,Why does it have to be hidden? We can't see the bare breast of the king? Sacred? What about Jesus? Was he full of all this pomp? No!
abcfgh, Over there, Your mocking a private moment concerning the King's faith means that there's an open invitation to film the dying moment of one of your nearest and dearest when the time comes. I mean why does it have to be hidden or sensibilities observed?
DMcL, Harrogate,"Would you like to sit there and remove your top of front of millions and bear your chest? You might, I certainly wouldn't. Ut was a breach of privacy. What is it with everyone theses days they have to see everything even at the risk of their jobs!"
heavenly hump , Isle of Skye,Defund the BBC! Not fit for purpose.
Yvonne333, East Sussex ENGLAND,A friend of harrys?!
HolmeBoy, Holmfirth,"Why the secrecy? What are they hiding from? A bishop a king and a bottle of oil, ooo I say."
Allie WR, North Norfolk Coast,"If the anointing had been filmed, people would be saying is nothing sacred anymore."
Sean McNeil, Edinburgh,Well done Charles
boudika, london,After Bashir set up Diana I think the BBC should be banned from going anywhere near the Royal Family....
ElBarone82, Sussex,Am sure the guy was working for Murdoch trying to get the pictures no one  else was allowed...

Lulubell22, Cardiff,Miserable
puddytatt, sheffield,You're just Thick.
tayop, london,It's normal journalistic instinct to reveal the hidden..he was only trying to do his job as a photo journalist
Wishilivedelsewhere, Utopia,"That failed at that during cov,id then. "
hognog, Birmingham,So no morals then? No respect for an individuals right to privacy? Sums up the BBC at the moment.
Zaphe, Traws,What on earth??? Where's David Icke when you need him?
Watchingman, Loughborough,Great reporting from a paper that uses lip readers to report on private conversations
Fwederick, Stafford,"Nothing is private if you are visible in public. Lip readers are hardly a new thing, they'll have AI that can do it soon if they don't already."
Watchingman, Loughborough,"That's a good point; I was in the pub the other day, and i could lip read your GP talking about your haemorrhoids"
Heather, London,"Seeing that the public SAW it ALL on TV I don't understand, if it wasn't meant for the public to see why was it shown to us to see on TV?"
Bernadette, Cork,The anointing was not shown on TV. 
pammio1, Weymouth,The BBC camerman was filming during the rehearsal on his private phone. This is not allowed and he was quite rightly thrown out.

Rob London, LONDON,Why wasn't he sacked?
Doctor Ash Tre, Los Angeles,"I'm sick of all these people who think they are all that. They think that having an education and using their brains means something. It doesn't.
Join us monarchists in supporting King Charles and his family
The earth is 6000 years old and his family created it."
Gsd2019, Uk,Earth is more like 4.4 billion years old approx not 6000 years 
puddytatt, sheffield,What?
Rob London, LONDON,He is definitely my King if he did that!
martmcg, warrington,Nice to see DM did their research and showed a photo of the wrong anointing oil container then!
BinkyBoo, Sheffield,Well I thought that but maybe it's the container used to transport the oil from Jerusalem. It was maybe then decanted into the Coronation ampulet?
RightWingTed, London,"If true, it's far more likely a newspaper tabloid was paying him. Work out for yourself who'd be most interested in that footage."
Suzymosaicquilts, Gloucester,Perhaps Netflix for Harry's next episode
Lord Devonshire, Torquay,I loathe the BBC.
manker, Derby,I believe it was Harry's man from Netflix in disguise.

default_, Diego Garcia,Bbc owned by the British government its chairman is a tory yet DM made its gullible readers that its run by the ta.liban and Diane abbot 
Strangleytoo, Sunny Uplands Unicornshire,I wonder what the king thinks about the DM using Iip readers to publish his private conversations?  I would say that is far more intrusive than revealing how a magic trick is done

Rose English , Newark England ,Read the history of your country.
Clemmie, London,Well sort of - the bare breast is anointed. It's very private and that should be respected by everyone including BBC employees. I suspect that man hoped to flog the footage for money. I'm glad his boss tore up his accreditation - quite right.
Josephine Agbobu, Lagos,"BBC, the most credible and professional news print in Britain. Out for facts no matter what it takes to get it."
PeeWee, Cheshire,Not always facts......
Shove your oar in, Boggy Bottom,I thought too at the actual coronation that the cameras were being much too obtrusive when Charles was supposed to be hidden behind the screens to be anointed. Very poor show.
No Policies Starmer, Swings like a Weathervane,The BBC hate Britain and they will do their best to destroy it.
Clearform44, Leeds,Sacred anointing?  What a load of religious twaddle. About time we got rid of this horrible family of benefit scroungers.

Chrissy2345, Bristol,Destroying any existing trust the BBC have
Caoineadh, Ex London,The actual signing of the marriage register is another ceremony that cannot be photographed or filmed. The reason is that there are four marriage entries to each double page of the register and photographing might infringe the privacy of the other couples. The book is then turned to empty pages and the couple pose for photos.

Lord Whiteley, Whiteley,"Good move Charles. Stand no nonsense.
The BBC is getting closer to loosing it's franchise every day. The just don't know how to behave do they?"
Dr Chung Chung., LONDON,"For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light.
"
DutchBrum, Maastricht,"In some respects, it has been been ""revealed"" in that we know what happens during the anointing, but the act itself is still considered sacred and is carried out away from public view. "
The Fish, Birmingham,He'll never work again!
Russell B, Colchester,"The BBC is one of the most evil institutions in the land ,given the chance they would destroy Britain completely."
Interested19, Northamptonshire,Another mail in the BBC.
Dr Chung Chung., LONDON,"LUKE 8,17 For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open."
DutchBrum, Maastricht,See my reply to the same comment you made a few posts above. 
The Fish, Birmingham,"Apparently, the sacred anointing is done with Charlie only wearing a nappy. They then smear his whole body in lubricant and chase him around, smacking him with a small twig from a blueberry bush!"
sentry57, Leeds,Are you confusing it with your evenings at home?
The Fish, Birmingham,"sentry57, I must admit, I have tried it but it's not the same if you haven't been chosen by God!"
jaytay87, Staffordshire,But somebody still filmed a bit where King Charles was having his breast anointed. I thought it was wrong at the time. The screens are there for a purpose.
JonMidlands, UK,"You have to laugh at the comments - any excuse to blame the BBC. The DM would have published that footage if it had the chance, hypocrite s "
VIY, World,"BBC is partly a spy agency, but not sure who their masters are.  "
october32, Sacked By Cummings,? What happened in the box?
Y-m, Lancashire,What do they lubricate with the oil?
Ms B, London,"I read in a previous article that they anoint his hands, head and chest. "
Says a Royal Expert, Windsor,Another good reason to double the licence fee.
JoLovesLondon, London,"The BBC are an absolute disgrace. They do us down constantly. They charged GB News a small fortune for the coronation stream for their excellent coverage, although we pay for it. They even tried to block GB News from the news pool to which they distribute their overpriced monopoly streams. And how many ridiculously overpaid presenters did they have for the Concert? At least six."
Sweeney Todd , Woken World England Aka,Well said...
Lord Whiteley, Whiteley,We watched it on Sky News. Can't get GB News where we are. Though even Sky kept harping on about and drawing attention to anarchist protesters.
Bazinga2, HAMILTON,"Did the guy have a pen in his hand? He's allergic to pens
 But not to sponging.."
Caroline, Warrington,How childish of you. 
EriktheEnglishviking, Elverum,or do@@ing
Chriatina, Derbyshire,Can we move on 
Ms B, London,From the BBC's betrayal of Britain and Britishness?  No. 
Bobtail123, raglan,"What I am finding extremely intrusive are the 'lip readers' who are disallowing any private conversation to remain that, private. What is the point of making a song and dance about Harry's potential revelations when many newspapers are using such money grabbing 'lip readers' ?"
Caroline, Warrington,Because newspapers are in the gutter. 
Lolly310, Hampshire,"The lip readers are on the RF payroll not the DMs. Same as the royal 'experts', royal 'sources' and body language 'experts'"
Whatsername65, Sheffield,Allegedly!
Zombieworld, Ulan Bator,"Oh, not the rolling up the left trouser leg, three finger handshake, flying helmet, and stick of wet celery ? Not that secret ceremony? I've been there,done it, and got the tattoo on the bum to prove it old chap!"
Lord Whiteley, Whiteley,Something like that.
alnero2, Southampton,"I think you are lost, nipper !"
patelout, Manchester,Scrap the license! Defund the woke joke they call the bbc!
Roast Gammon, Here,Why is it you anti-BBC goobers can never spell licence?

GreenThursday, London,Not a M ason  then ?
cjsallstars, Newcastle,We pay for it why can't we see it ?
Roast Gammon, Here,"Annabelle, this was the first time ever that the anointment of the monarch was shielded from view."
DutchBrum, Maastricht,"Roast Gammon......nope, you're wrong. It has always been shielded from public eyes, rewatch the coronation of QEII.  "
A London, London,Some have no shame. Charles was right. For once the BBC was right. It was a private spiritual moment
Dead Gorgeous, Nirvana,I see the servile mentality is alive and well in the U.K.!
luvFreedom2000, multi culti London,Phew kicked the cameraman out before he could catch Chuck swearing loyalty to Mammon for the riches.
Mike, In the Countryside,The BBC should be thrown off the airwaves permanently
jimnyj, leeds,"""allegedly"" =  made up DM story. "
LaLa, LaLaLand,Just like the constant barrage of Harry BS
Lifebeginsnow, Essington,It is being reported in other newspapers too.
HamandEggs, North Pole,The screen is there for a reason it is a moment the king commits himself to his and that is a very very private thing and has been for centuries!  The king was right and the unprofessional journalist and media channel is wrong and is a systemic issue across MSN now lack of respect and low quality journalism!
Ginger Blobcat, The Coviet Union,"I thought the king had to get undressed behind that screen,  and be rubbed down with holy oil!"
DutchBrum, Maastricht,"Itchee you don't think the RF, and the monarch in particular, should be allowed the same rights of privacy as you yourself enjoy? "
com.sen1, All,Delboy Charles is the one whom should have controlled himself Diana was young he should have leas by example and chose his lower person instead 
thegoat, Sheffield,Let sleeping dogs lie. 
Shark Trager, Castleknock ,"Charlie having a meltdown over nothing, some poor fella will lose his job over this...despicable typical petulant Charlie."
Kid Jody, ENGLAND,He deserves to loose his job.
Caroline, Warrington,Actions have consequences. 
Zlisters, Kings Lynn,It's absolutely shocking. Thank goodness King Charles spotted him first. Also these newspapers using lip readers. Now that's just disgusting.....
Itchee Bawlsak, Camillatown on Trent on Stoke,"Yes, goodness forbid the truth come out. Can't have the peasants finding out what really happens behind the palace walls now, can we ?? They might no like what they see."
RabD, Glasgow,BBC should have been banned as camera man only carrying out instructions
Luckysaint, Wakefield , Not with a mobile phone though 
jamesmax1974, Leeds,"He's our king, there should be no secrets."
jamesmax1974, Leeds,Then let's see it.
Thepreaching.com, Germiston,Is that which is public knowledge that which actually happens?
Bhagwan Hardcastle, Oldham,How would the footage have been broadcast if filming were not allowed? Unless the photographer had some other agenda..
dog mad, uk,"Read the article, they were using a mobile phone and had moved from the spot they were in. So they were probably planning on selling the footage."
HamandEggs, North Pole,Its called cash ! Disgusting behaviour from the so called journalist
Jimmybob1983, Hell,You can't film the shape-shifting part
HamandEggs, North Pole,You watch too much TV grow up
Fooling no one, Berkshire,"I havent spoken to anyone who says they watched it, why are they ashamed of admitting it,  I watched and loved it. Hated the concert though. "
susie, leics,Everyone I knew watched it. We gathered with family to watch it.
DutchBrum, Maastricht,"I watched the coronation from the NL and loved it, didn't bother with the concert though. "
Hayhol, Eccles,"Most intimate moment ? what was going on there then,lol."
JAR, Southampton,Are you 4?
jess o, Plymouth,"Well done King Charles Journalist in this country are at times lowest of the low what next tapping peoples phones oh sorry yes they have already done that , The palace should name the creep "
DelBoy lytham, lytham,The guy probably worked for Netflix as well!
Man in a suitcase, Amounderness,"Why no film of the frog marching ?
  "
Lyn, Adelaide,Check out the nastiness and stupidity that spewed out of of ABC  Australia. Just another arm of the BBC
BlueSkies100, Madrid,"The BBC are PATHETIC .,,,, CANCEL YOUR LICENSE AND BUY A ROKU BOX FROM ARGOS ... 19.99 ... TOTALLY LEGAL ... Just disconnect your aerial and that's it"
MT, Chatham,"You still need a licence for broadcast TV and BBC iPlayer. We watch neither and do not have a license or a ROKU box, just a smart TV."
Filly100, Cardiff,Shameful behaviour.  These days many journalists have no respect.  He should be named and shamed!
Greatlife1, England,London lefties are loosing it over this. Good and well done King Charles. 
HamandEggs, North Pole,London lefties live on another planet ! Metropolitan bubbles have. O contact with reality or the rest of the UK
Albert Pike, Papeete,How many times! Losing!..Not loosing.

com.sen1, All,Diana I mean 
DelBoy lytham, lytham,She was at it as well. 
Officiallyoverthis, Essex,"Good, the BBC and those that work for them are just grubby bottom feeders"
Elderly Gentleman, Reading,I doubt that the cameraman was working for the BBC. He probably expected to be a millionaire by June. 
hettyf, Chelmsford,Personally I think it was a shame it was conducted in secret I think it's a lovely thing to do and yes sacred but why do it in secret?
Albert Pike, Papeete,You're not worthy to see it! (That's the theory anyway).
hettyf, Chelmsford,But its part of a very public ceremony. If its a personal moment have it at home!
The real PM, Mkt Weighton,Probably it never happened.
Sassenach98, wincanton,"A picture of that silly ceremony could have been worth millions from the media perspective. Obviously not paid enough by the BEEB. !
AS AN 8 year old I enjoyed the ""wonder"" of the 1953 spectacle,  this time I'm less overawed. Thought HE  just looked ridiculous. !!!"
JardineLarney, London,The buckled shoes.....
Kay49, Oregon City,"I have to agree. And if course given how WOKE this King is, the ceremony hit all the DEI/CRT boxes! A shame really"
Cityboy84, London,Yeah this is the bit of the service that states this is Gods choice for monarch. Make of that what you will
Danny Darko, London,"Great headline  the words  BBC & thrown out  go hand in hand

Would Like  to see the bbc thrown out of blighty altogether  as they don't represent  blighty anymore  they are way too

D i v e r s e !!!!!

For all things that are  british"
Cityboy84, London,You need to get over yourself
Danny Darko, London,You need to mi d your own business and just read the comments kid 
sam, here,Its about respecting others privacy. I dont need to know why I cant see something. If its important to someone else then thats good enough for me.
Albert Pike, Papeete,Baa!
Kathy, Gourock,Good for King Charles typical BiasedBC.
PopthePup, Milton Keynes,You obviously have no idea what biased even means.
IllIllIllIll, Deal,Name and shame!
Chickenbeakin, THE BIG SMOKE,Not the first time BBC thinks of themselves.
Ian B, London,"None of this should be secret, X we're paying for it!"
jezzza55, Romford,Have a sense of occasion.
Kay49, Oregon City,I mean what's a little holy oil among few friends?
dinkie1993, Solihull,"Quite right, BBC employees just don't know when to stop sometimes."
alicemorris90, london,Do you know any personally?
Lal48, Darwin,Bashir comes to.mind
Ianofpoolebay, POOLE,Stuff & nonsense.
holland, bolton,The BBC didn't film ' that series ' other suspects SURELY ........
RH6mre2, The South,Good. De-fund the BBC.
Chris M, Wherever I Stop,"Why do some people think they have a right to pry into or film everything, especially private occasions, to no doubt make money."
Media hawk, Rugby,What is so special about the anointing?  I plead ignorance of the fact.
Chickenbeakin, THE BIG SMOKE,If any...
John111111, london," Historically, it recognises the monarch's devine right to the throne. In other words, a load of nonsense."
Mongoose_, Living La Vida Loca,I would've done the same.. who cares
Fenella, London,You must be a millennial.
sam, here,Because you have low standards of respect.
G10, Middle England,The BBC clearly forgot to mention the incident in their subsequent news bulletins 
pip, Tel-Aviv,It was not a gaffe. This is the BBC we are talking about. The sad part in all this is that they will get away with it again.
isg, London,"Sacred indeed, what a load of nonsense, that said the cameraman knew the rules and broke them so deserved to be booted out."
vaughan55, northampton,Shouldnt have employed him. Its asking for trouble.
Jack, London,That's got to be sedition. Only one punishment is appropriate!
Dissatisfied_Citizen, null,Did you realise that Christ's crime was sedition.
sam, here,Lol
Danny Darko, London,"Typical lefty attitudes never minding their own  business  as they clearly  think they are above all within  society

And they have all the same look , bitter and very envious


"
Royal Malarkey, Somewhere,"Charlzzz would have had a major hissy fit during those rehearsals and many more in the lead up to his coro. He is a very impatient creature with a very bad temper on a good day........BTW, we cannot comment freely on the Charlzzz and Camzzz taking a break in Sandringham. Why DM?"
Countrydelight, Coleraine,Another troll here
Kay49, Oregon City,Not everyone is a fan of this woke King
Paul, Leicester,There is no end to the lows the BBC will go to....
Major Hindsight, UK,Typical BBC...banish the TV license.
Daibhi, Antwerpen,The beloved Conservatives have been in power for 13 years and have had adequate opportunity to scrap the TV licence - and haven't 
winifred3937, carnforth,"What is soo worrying is how did he get that close to the area that Prince Charles himself spotted him

Unbelievable"
lass from london, summertown,"He was a cameraman just perhaps he was filming in that area and decided to take a chance,good bye career."
Ponyead, Plymouth,People who are accredited to be there are security checked prior to being issued the necessary passes. Unfortunately you can't when carrying out checks be 100% certain of someone honesty and integrity.  Its quite obvious that this person saw an opportunity to make money. Hopefully the BBC will take appropriate action but not holding my breath. 
Realy, Rhindda,"Let's face it, the biblical anointing of kings in scripture was meant only in the line of David which the Christ (meaning anointed one) came through, once he was anointed, then the purpose was served and once his sacrifice was accepted, the curtain to the most holy was rent in two etc.   "
Kay49, Oregon City,Interesting. Thanks for sharing that
ChimpMaster, Staffordshire,De a th penalty. 
Impartially speaking, UK,Im just amazed they can fit a paddling pool in such a small area!
Royally Suffolk, Ipswich,Surely you're confusing this with baptism?! What's a paddling pool got to do with anointing a King?
maggot, Brighton,The camera people were probably bribed with huge bonuses from the powers that be at the BBC to get any footage they can of any part of the ceremony that they weren't supposed to film. 
Mr XYZ, Wiltshire,Utter twaddle 
Big softie, Devon,"Why......what would be the point of filming something that could never be shown on tv. They would be sued,so would gain nothing. "
liz.sunak, somewhere,"""allegedly"""
Hampshire66, Winchester,I don't understand why anointing is a screened off private act when baptism of babies is so public.
Countrydelight, Coleraine,Tradition
Albert Pike, Papeete,"One is a load of nonsense and the other is complete bunkum,...You decide."
Equal Suffrage, Collingwood,Should put him in the Tower of London 
Go get em Floyd, Funky Town,"Another attempt at undermining the monarchy from within our ""state broadcaster."" It is clear that clearance for those in trusted positions is not taken seriously enough by the BBC. What a surprise!!"
Tulips, New Hampshire,"The BBC should be thrown out altogether. Absolutely appalling, biased anti British broadcaster."
PaulCarey, Liverpool,Its strange they would have a private hidden part of the ceremony. Makes you wonder what or who they didn't want people to see. 
imarime, Canadian New Yorker in London,"Some things are sacred, not secret"
Countrydelight, Coleraine,Don't talk rubbish
Ooopsy, PRESTON,Typical bbc ..... time to defund
Ruprecht Jamison, Beaumont-sur-Mer,"He would have then been flogging the phone footage to the Guardiian  or Miirror or other left wiing rag, or uploading it to a personal Twiitter account for likes and shares.
"
Mr XYZ, Wiltshire,"Yes, indeed, and the underlying mentality/mindset of such a person is truly mind-boggling - such a lack of respect, honour, morality and ethics - a classic BBC mindset/ethos... !!"
TheSagePhilosopher, Andromeda,"The fool was subsequently arrested for high treason and held up in the tower, while the swordsman was sent for from Calais. "
The past is best, Staffordshire,"How slimey of them trying film the rehearsal.
They were after something divisive as per.
They really are the underbelly of our country,that continue stoking an already very divided society caused mostly by msm"
Rimmy, Toronto,"Some people have no respect for anyone or anything, especially that which is considered sacred and private"
Mike S., DisUnited Kingdom,That's the bbc mindset for you. Lefties think it's all nonsense so they can do as they like
Mr XYZ, Wiltshire,"Yes, classic arrogant and controlling lefty BBC mindset... The rules and ethics apply to others, not them !!"
Brian, Aberdeen,Another good reason to defund the bbc
charlie62, salford,The guy after being thrown out went and got well oiled.
catlover1993, seattle,Who sewed that gorgeous screen?
Lumpy snow, Thanet,"Oh god. Could they sink so much lower. No, not a Charles fan (I understand British history so not particularly bothered about his taking the throne), but to actually INTRUDE on a very private moment?


It's like pe.......r.......X's who stick cameras under public toilet (USA, bathroom) cubicles.



Thank CHRIST I got shot of them 1/3/19."
Sigismund Arbuthnot, London,Axe the BBC Tax 
Sigismund Arbuthnot, London,"@Lumpy I do not pay the BBC Tax, but I believe it should not even exist. "
Lumpy snow, Thanet,"Sig, sorry, correct.


The BBC are a f.......as......hiZT gang that get off on terrifying old ladies.



I'm very glad you booted them out of your home, like me."
ByeByeDutton, Melbourne,What the hell was going on behind that screen?   Weird.
AVCE64, Victoria,"ByeBye, if you CARE to find out - which you clearly do not - all is explained about the annointing ceremony, as someone else here said, it's not secret, just private."
Juan  Zerbino, Barcelona,A copy quick leaf through Razzle magazine and a laugh about all the pIebs paying for this ceremony?
Beau Brummel, Decadence,"So...... that's what those long rods are for, with the strange tips on the top and the tub of vaseline."
Marco, Toronto,You're thinking of your bedroom.
Rimmy, Toronto,Disgusting comment about a sacred ritual.  You chose the name of your city well! Must have put a lot of thought into that
Newlondonbird44, London,"Sacred anointment....Good Lord.
This is human ritual not divine intervention.
This is all made up superstitious claptrap which has been passed down the centuries because humans need something to worship and are like sheep. "
Rimmy, Toronto,"Have some respect, please. You're entitled to your own opinion however vile it may be"
Mr XYZ, Wiltshire,"Indeed, Sig... And why not... So many countries and cultures have nothing like it... We are so lucky to have such wonderful traditions that we can revel in and parade, renew and celebrate from time to time, even if some miserable folk are opposed to it..."
GOsbourneHK, hong kong,"Sacred, magic anointment oil from olives in the holy land. What a load of hocus pocus.

Did the Archbishop also use the magic words Abracadabra and magic wand as part of the ceremony? "
Rimmy, Toronto,Well I guess you know all about hocus pocus in your neck of the woods
Windsorneighbour, Windsor,"How stupid anyway. Okay, assuming this is true....what was the guy going to do ? Sell screen shot pix of the rehearsal of that key moment to the tabloids for 50 quid a pop ? And then NOT think anyone would know who'd taken the original picture ?  How stupid was he... good they reportedly ripped up his ID on the spot."
Anonymous, Unknown,"The UK is no longer a theocratic state, why the church traditions involved and all these cross symbols must be replaced by peace ones, cross refer to gross punishment after all."
Rimmy, Toronto,"Yes, and gross refers to the disgusting comment from HammidR"
Rimmy, Toronto,He wouldn't even comprehend that!
Vicessa-492, Accrington,"If he'd worked for Channel 4 he'd have faked them, then asked for comments! Then he'd gain great acclaim and an award!"
Anti Vinegarstrokes, Near Here,They should have banned the whole of the BBC as punishment. Would have knocked their rating for the day
johnny d, brighton,"God, I hate the BBC"
Viktor_Meldrew, The Sunny South,"Thank god(whichever one/ones/none you do or don't believe in) that they can now get back to their separate homes, not knowing what a hard job or hard work is! Two idle people doing what they do best...... Nothing! "
Scentedrose, Everywhere,Try looking up what they do and educate yourself. You will be surprised. 
Rimmy, Toronto,"Bye bye, Viktor. Time to go back to your own separate home"
Anonymous, Unknown,This is a crime against journalism and free of speech. The commoners pay for the whole thing and his majesty deprives them from even watching it on TV.
Rimmy, Toronto,You have some sort of 'unusual' curiosity or a complete  lack  of  understanding regarding privacy
Mr XYZ, Wiltshire,"VERY VERY OBVIOUS BRAND NEW TROLL ACCOUNT ALERT
7th May"
Gavsky23, Durham,"That's not a good career move - the least you can do is respect the rules & behave professionally. I suspect we have a ""MUST film this"" type - they suddenly appear at medical emergencies, road accidents etc. & gormlessly film, regardless of how inappropriate it is. Some, sadly, are even members of the Emergency Services!"
Vicessa-492, Accrington,And Police!
Rimmy, Toronto,"Yes,  they used to be referred to as 'ghouls'"
Csmithy1980, Chorley,"Allegedly, this story sounds a bit made up"
Mr XYZ, Wiltshire,"YOU sound ""a bit made up""..."
Caz20, Hampshire,"So only the cameraman was allegedly thrown out. I would say, when you know for sure then report it. At the moment it's only hearsay. DM trying to stir the pot again."
Red Arrows Show, Love For Meghan,"As this is a BBC article can I remind DM readers not to forget to pay the license fee. It's wonderful value for money, now carry on commenting xx "
Scentedrose, Everywhere,Lol! 
kiwigirl999, eketahuna,Anointing!! So bizarre 
Rimmy, Toronto,Says the girl from Eketahuna. Strange!
Christomcg, sydney,"Good, well done. Media think they can do and say anything, even when not true, flower the whole issue up!"
liz.sunak, somewhere,Allegedly - they always put that in when they make stuff up.
Vicessa-492, Accrington,Or reported by an unknown source?
morgain, Amersfoort,"The BBC is not what it used to be, only trying to be pc, trailer trash on the paylist, no standards anymore.
"
B D1, London,Name those you claim are trash. Then we will all see you in court over it.
Vicessa-492, Accrington,Bashir?
WideAwayke, Neverland,If it was Gary Lineker the BBC would have stood by him.
B D1, London,Utterly barking mad!
Mr XYZ, Wiltshire,"BD, please stop talking about yourself and add comments of value... Thanks !!"

ALPHA PAPA, West Sussex,"Probably some secret sat anic, ab use ritual "
Thepreaching.com, Germiston,They love and worship Jimmy's bestie.
ALPHA PAPA, West Sussex,Thank you @Mummytotwo. At last someone with decency.......shame on the others that just look the other way! 
ExBritishMilitary, OnTheRoad,The BBC need hauling over some very substantial coals for this.
Anglophile1010, Johannesburg,"Agree, shouldn't be filmed but why the secrecy - can't see the need to hide one's allegiance & devotion to God?  Someone fill me in please."
Rimmy, Toronto,Decent people respect moments of privacy. Ignorant people do not know the meaning of the word
Anglophile1010, Johannesburg,"Thanks to those offering actual insight.

@Rimmy
Feel superior now, do we?  If you've nothing worthwhile to add, why bother."
Jim Warner, Perth,"I love the history of our shared monarchy and I love the unique and rich cultural heritage of your nation. My father once found Anglo-Saxon coins that were 1500 years old in England! Despite being smaller in area than Michigan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has shaped the modern world in so many ways. You gave the world the jet engine, the train, the flushing toilet, the World Wide Web, the telephone, the television, stainless steel, stereo sound, the vaccination, the lawn mower, the laptop, the tin can, the ATM. Even football, rugby, cricket and boxing was invented by you British! Then there's the fire extinguisher, the light switch and DNA fingerprinting. Britain has also produced 5 of the top 8 best-selling authors in history, as well as 5 of the top 9 biggest selling music acts in history."
cornwallforever, Truro,"The whole Industrial Revolution began here, the UK literally changed the entire world - though some would argue it was better before."
Chocolate_Teapot-2, West Midlands ,Thanks ever so much for summarising our nation's achievements. 
John Davidson BHFC, Brighton,It's not secret. But it is deeply private.

E1878FC, UK,"I believe this story completely, I really do, allegedly."
Bob Brisbane, Brisbane,I'm glad the BBC got kicked out but 'magical oil'... seriously :-) LOL.

Honest, Green  Pleasant Land,God save the king
lh565, london,"Good one, these nosy journalists need a taste of their own medicine "
DavetheSmythe, Indian Heaven,"Secret ceremony?  Could the RF get anymore creepy?  They're in a cult church, that religion was started by a RF member to cater to that RF and then it, the cult,  installs the least acceptable people as head of that cult.  Crazy, tribal islanders."
alfiebrown, Redcar,My God that's rich coming from a citizen of a country full weirdo cult religion's. Like a citizen of Haiti complaining about theires Voodoo in another country.
Wendy291, Paris,Malarkey is correct.
The Eternal Watcher, London,Any party who abolished TV licence will get my vote.
Pik, London,500 years ago he would have lost his head.
Themanfromthepru, Deal,500 yrs ago King Charles was beheaded.
Beeline, South of England,"That worked out well, didn't it."
growlley, wigan,sacred secret parts as made up in the early 1900's
MollyDS, Bath,"Not secret, private."
growlley, wigan,still made up  as most of the rituals were never written down and a long gap meant they were lost - so they made them up for 'spectacle' to impress the guillabe 
My mate Frank, No United.,"I don't know why the bbc hypocrites were even there, they hate the royal family in fact they hate the U.K. time it was defunded."
PendleWitch, lancashire,Defund the RF ? what an awesome idea!
Colin58, Southend,"How much is the cameraman's house worth, bad journalism from the DM"
AmpneyCrucis, Cardiff,"Yes, and has he got taut abs? Must try harder DM"
packetofgravel, Dorset,"Hope he lost his job. Also, it's not a secret part of the ceremony, just that it's private. There is a difference. "
Peter Dawkins, Herts,"The DM never uses the word ""private"" when it can say SECRET."
John White, Huntingdon,Harry would know.
chrisgllovell, Belfast,"People commenting saying the BBC is entitled? Really?

We've literally just watched an entitled unelected family all weekend and celebrated being called their subjects?

That's entitlement"
HiDest, LA,Just a matter of personal privacy...I can understand that....
Kellyrocks, Somewhere,This BBC cameraman will not be forgotten by Charles!
Independent Brit, Baldock,"Perhaps he will, however, be forgotten by the BBC after he got caught out.  Bet that won't go on his resume."
jaypeebee63, Avarua,God forbid the public find out what their public funding is secretly funding.
Independent Brit, Baldock,The public didn't fund this.  The proceeds paid into the Treasury during the last financial year alone  from the Crown Estate's income covered the total cost of the coronation twice over. 
Miss Sensible, London,"@independent and the funeral,  did it cover those costs too.  I bet they didn't pay a penny for all that Estate either."
joeYg, London,"BBC yet again doing as they please, when will they be shut down - it's well overdue. "
Interested_observer, Melbourne,It's their sense of entitlement the BBC and their staff have that is so abrasive. I hope the guy lost his job.
CandidOne, Oxford,And Harry too
Medusa99, Melbourne,"Secret? Sacred? Nothing sacred about this traitorous, treasonous half-witt."

Giveitaname, Utopia,And lo... I anoint thee  with the holy WD40...
Giveitaname, Utopia,"admiral - nope. Home owner (private not ex council), working full time, just capable of independent thought, not a sheep. Shame others don't like it, isn't it? I'm not religious, don't judge others, but won't be judged either. Would I bow if I ever met big ears? No way! Don't disrespect or mean them any harm, but this blind devotion just makes me (and  if I may very dare according to you, be so bold, sorry, bow, scrape, doff my hat) just ask questions, or challenge things etc... Do you feel threatened by such things? Do you need to seek counselling? You seem so unaccepting of alternative views, but bet you watch ""Have I Got News For You"" and laugh, eh? Anyway, I live to my own code:Peace and long life, live long and prosper, be excellent to each other and... PARTY ON DUDE! But always be inquisitive, remain curious, ask questions, and don't be a sheep!"
admiralaustroonia, Zubia,Confirmed  - working class and very boring. Unintelligent too.
Missmissey, Nocity,Quite right
thinking84, London,How dare a journalist try to document the secret anointing! Our independent journalists should do as they're told by the secretly anointed unelected monarch. This is Britain after all.
JJ, The World,"He was trying to film unofficially on his phone, probably to sell. It wasn't journalism."
Doctor Ash Tre, Los Angeles,Nointy anointy no real pointy.
CherryPink, South Oxfordshire,"The choice you face in 2024 - where the winner will be the one who can BUY himself the slickest campaign - and you have the nerve to say ""no real point"" to US?  It's true, then - Americans really DON'T get irony, do they?"
Doctor Ash Tre, Los Angeles,"True Britons bowing down to a man that was descended from the angles and Saxons and not true Britons.
Is that ironic enough?"
abcfgh, Over there,Well that's his career over as he can't be trusted.  Makes you wonder what else he films secretly and what is on his phone.
Chris M, Wherever I Stop,"Hell more than likely be promoted, its the BBC remember "
John White, Huntingdon,He will get a job at The guardian. 
Sue Denholme, London,I cant help but chuckle at this preposterous secret sacred anointing business.  Cloud cuckoo land!
AVCE64, Victoria,"Sue, are you mates with traitorous Harold???"
Sue Denholme, London,Ask the sky fairy to answer that question for you xx
guy.burgess, West Meon,I saw Claire Foy get anointed in THE CROWN. She got olive oil placed in three places. That's all I'm gonna say. Don't want the SAS breaking down my door.
stokepotter, stoke-on-trent,"""The Crown"" TV show as we all know is fiction. This at the very least was an invasion of privacy.. "
JulietAlpha, London,Grow up
EnglishLord, Bembridge,Yes what was the anointing and why could we not see this and was camilla anointed?
MollyDS, Bath,"Yes, she was, but just on her forehead so she declined privacy"
Scentedrose, Everywhere,Only the monarch is anointed. 
Nizami, Baku,I noticed on Saturday that the BBC camera accidentally captured a little bit of the anointing when it filmed the crack between the middle and right screens for a few seconds.
Jlssgf, Hants,Nothing is sacred. It was a Christian ceremony.  
imarime, Canadian New Yorker in London,Your comment makes no sense
Gladiator, Arena,So walking behind a screen needed rehearsals 
tiggerpops, StraightToHell,Are you really so ignorant as not to understand why it was rehearsed? I despair. 
Kiev1910, nowhere,Good for Chaz
I_Daniel, London,"""Chaz""? How disrespectful!"
Us, In the UK,"Chat, , , do you mean charlie boy?"
Jerry FS, North of East,Nothing surprises me about the UK hating BBC. They really are despicable and not worthy of the disgusting licence fee tax.
callum99, Notts,I heard they like to employ billingual people. Disgusting. 
GrassyA55, MonteCristo,"Oh Gammon, do behave."
Disgusted of Ely, Ely,Perhaps he was acting under instructions from his bosses? We know the bar is low. They all knew about jimmy S.
catlover1993, seattle,"If the tabloids hack phones, which is despicable, the BBC isn't too good to peek through the screen. So rude."
hsmatharu, Lem Spa,Exactly
sayitlikeitisplease, Metropolis,Good on him. What is it they have to hide? Lizard upgrade?
JulietAlpha, London,So true
Kid Jody, ENGLAND,"No such thing as lizard people, however there's an abundance of trolls living and making comments on this subject."
Archibald meatpants, London,I've got the story without buying the Sun. Result.
ZeZe, Glasgow,Secret anointing?  LOL
JulietAlpha, London,Spot on
Royal Malarkey, Somewhere,With olive oil brewed up last month. 
Deirdre, Dublin,What went on behind those screens is that Meghan appeared from underneath the throne and there was an almighty hug
ZeZe, Glasgow,He was handed the details of the offshore bank accounts
Avocado66, London,The BBC are getting too big for their boots .....
BoMoMoFo, Bournemouth,And this guy who walks around with a fancy hat on who expects people to bow and scrape isn't too big for his boots? This royal nonsense is not for me thanks. 
ALIA, Australia,"No one is expecting anyone to bow or scrape, least of all the King. But if you have any respect for tradition there needs to be some sort of regard to rules or common decency. Obviously that was too much for the journalist in question to understand"
stopper, birmingham,Disgusting antics from the bbc. How low can they get?
Us, In the UK,As low as arresting someone for nothing
Mr Whiskers, Kensington,Not quite low enough to peep under the screens..
Christian Mike, Kathmandu,But is he swering a secret oath to sinister forces?
yorkshirepudding , thankfully I left the,"Can't answer that, no idea what swering means."
Thepreaching.com, Germiston,That's right. Neither the clergy or RF believe the Gospel so I'm sure neither parties care about anything remotely Christian. They were probably pledging allegiance to Lucifer.
Scousedownunder, Perth,What colour was he because if he was a white male then the DM would have wrote it in their headlines
pendragon25, Christchurch,"*written, not wrote."
FinalShrug, Lakeside,"BBC, no surprise . . . "
callum99, Notts,75 percent of Scots are Republican as opposed to 25 percent of English. So he's not wrong. 
Keshave, London,No wonder BBC has been repeatedly spreading  anti-monarchy leader's messages on its social media channels
BeforeSunset, Pireas,"I hope he abdicates. William will be a great King, not bothered with ripping up gardens to create a new garden at tax payer expenses etc.  I think he would shut down all of the traditional nonsense as well and just get on as a leader in a new age. It would also suit George to have his granddad available in late late years to guide while his father is reigning. Charles is far too selfish though. "
chelsea612, Ft. Lauderdale,"I think he will be like his Mother and carry on until the end.  He waited a long time, don't think he will give it up, unless he gets sick and can't perform any duties.  I think he will be a good King in the time he has left."
Derry05, Wrexham,"He has aged quite quickly of late but he's waited 74 years to get promoted! If was William being crowned though I'm sure there would be a lot more excitement around the royal family right now. However, I think it's good for William to be able to spend more time with his children while they are young and he hasnt got the responsibility of being the big boss yet!"
The Candy man, Scotland,Old sausage fingers won't last six years don't think. The Queen did him no favours by not relinquishing her crown much earlier. 
Sir Max Power, Basement At Twitter ,"I doubt it, he stay until he dies and pass on some duties to his son"
Bookrom27, London,"When you see that they didn't do anything during their own coronation weekend, that says a lot about what's next. They didn't even find time for the people who were picnicking. They preferred to give airtime to American Idol. Big laugh."
Spoo, Brighton,Have you check Charles's hands lately they are starting to look like the queen's before she sadly passed away. I believe there will be another royal funeral before this decade is finished
Meneer, nowhere,"I made a comment earlier in the day, saying the late Queen was a tough lady, what I mean to say is, that she was a very brave lady. Sorry for my wrong words."
tomkent, Somewhere in England,She WAS tough. Good Scottish genes!
iimwnfcqvlrprswrgo, I dont live in a city,"""because they believe the myths that 'women lie',""......and isn't believing the myth that ""women never lie"" just as bad?  How about just basing your decision as a jury member based on the evidence presented, not your predisposed beliefs?"
Joe40, USA,I give 2 years
Paulo Gabbini, LONDON,Harry for king!!!
Saltine, Anytown,"She has no idea what his routine was that morning or the night before, I'm sure it was a late night and a very early start in the morning. No wonder he looked tired!"
Fish-n-Chips, New England,Uneasy lies the head that wears the criwn
Fish-n-Chips, New England,*crown*
Bentham, Royton,Weary? He looked overcome with emotion. The following day he looked back to normal.
General Gwan, York,He's weak. 
martin, cheshire,evidence? Other than what the Lefties keep saying?
In search of truth, England,Charles will never hand over the rei(g)ns of being King.
VanFan1000, Pasadena,To me he looked weary at the coronation but more than anything unhappy. He had a very glum look on his face and I could not understand why.
patti, somewhere in Canada,Harry.
david1963, Blackpool,Perhaps thinking of his mother 
Yorkshire lady, Proudly up North,"It's what he has wanted for decades, as is his second wife. Now they've both ended up where they are beds and lying on them come to mind. The present Monarch will not give up his life's ambition at all. More likely is that the heir and his wife will end up doing more at a far earlier age than they might expect. We will see. "
eslizzy, SWINDON,"He is still grieving his parents. Yes he is an older man but your parents are your parents no matter how old you are. I lost my mum and her sister who was like a second mum to me in the space of eighteen months. I am still missing them dreadfully. He may be King but this will have happened immediately his mother died and he probably has had so much to deal with and do, not least dealing with his ungrateful son and unaware brother.  He has to keep going  and put his pain aside. He is clearly tired and needs some time away to rest. That will happen when he goes to one of his estates for the summer. At least he's lucky enough to be able to do that.  He will be fine but grief hurts, it will take time."
Side1234, Manavgat,"Your latest attempts at undermining Freedom of Speech are interesting. Publishing comments that don't follow your party line, one week after they have been made, so that they will not be read, It's a ploy worthy of Gobbels or Stalin."
illeuminator, mancyland,Never understood why a woman who spent most of her working life championing womens causes would then take a job with one of the most misogynistic newspapers in the country.
KiraHolland, New York ,You're complaining about how much the coronation cost us. Can someone actually show me a receipt of how much they've physically paid???
Sir Max Power, Basement At Twitter ,The coronation was a money cash cow for the UK
Tinkerbellxx, Atlantis,Totally disagree. Charles has never looked better. He's really come into his own since the Queen's funeral. 
Lady Whistle-down, England,"If I had arrived and had psyched myself up to go in it would have thrown me to then have to wait for 5 minutes especially due to someone else's tardiness. It was especially worse with the world's cameras on him. Few people would not have found that stressful. We cab only really liken it to this happening on say our Wedding day and yes, it would be stressful and this was a much bigger and public event"
Lady Whistle-down, England,"Ah, I have since been told he was early. Still, this was due to no fault of his own and this would throw most people."
Lady Whistle-down, England,"Firstly, one lip reader claimed he said this
What a disgusting article suggesting he will only be King for six years - it is unnecessary to speculate how long anyone has."
johns-girl, Bristol,I've got nothing particularly against Charles but those crowns do look very silly!
Scarp78, southampton,He is in his 70s. It was a long day for him but nothing a good night's sleep wouldn't cure. Leave him alone. He will fulfill his role as King and hopefully will retain the role until he dies thus leaving William to be able to spend time with his family while they are still young.
linda mcavoy, Kent,Jennifer imagine she looks good for age she looks tired out and half or our Kings age
stillsane, Northumberland ,"Utter nonsense, of course he was tired, who wouldn't be. No way will he give up the throne unless he dies. "
Copycat13, Simpletown,"Maybe Jenni, whoever you ate should retire also, she's a bit long in the tooth now!!"
Lindy, Bournemouth,He was stressed as one would expect and he will reign like his Mother until death!
TraciYoung, Hamilton,6yrs??? I thought his majesty was going to keel over during the ceremony
TraciYoung, Hamilton,6 years???  I thought his majesty was going to keel over during the ceremony
Franks, London,"You're about 80 and you still don't know how the line of succession works? Charles will be king until his passing, not before."
Bee3, Sydney,"Jenni wasn't listening.  KC3 arrived early, the Waleses weren't late."
TraciYoung, Hamilton,Exactly. Both ITV and BBC said he was 10 minutes early when they first arrived.
Lady Whistle-down, England,I didn't have commentary on so missed this fact and had since been told the Wales family were late. I was clearly misinformed.
dsurveyor1, Bude,"I don't think Charles is in the top job until ""death us do part"". There will come a time within the next 10 years when he will look carefully at the future of our monarchy and at 80+ realise the time to go with grace has arrived and let the younger ones take over."
Scarp78, southampton,I hope not. You can have a King while one still is alive. He will do what the Queen did and gradually relinquish some of the responsibility onto William but he should never abdicate.
Mark John Two, Republic Town,"Another 300 million , for tax payers....Then we get Mr Angry and Saint Catherine of Hypergamy ,the sandwich watcher..."
Franks, London,"Boohoo, Rachel. Don't you have some paps to call?"
Nora_Batty, London,Should have given it to William.
Franks, London,Doesn't work like that. Get it through your skull already
Planetman, York,Give him a chance Jenni. He has only just been crowned our King and already you are trying to get rid of him. He has waited nearly a lifetime to become our monarch and I am sure he will take whatever he has left of his life to make the most of his position and do it admirably.
Billymitchell, nowhereland ,Two words 'sleepy' joe Biden ) oh that's three isn't it..
loser, London,Couldn't disagree more.  He will be there until death.
Emily, West Mids,"I can't see him lasting 6 years, he doesn't look well"
gr8mascot, london,"I agree with Jenni, he did look fril at The Coronation"
London1976, Rochester,Who cares what Jenni thinks?
loser, London,Absolutely.  Great comment.
MegaChippy, Warrington,And what then?....another 100 million on another coronation which was THE biggest waste of money in the  current  climate. 
Platipus, Newcastle on Tyne,Mycatmurphy - Old news - Harry is often called Harold because he claimed that was the nickname William had for him.
Texanpete, Dallas Texas,"It's very simple...King Charles is protecting Prince George...Charles knows what it's like to become the heir at such a young age. He won't step down as that will make George the heir which is a role he could have for many, many years.."
Decorum, Region Lemanique,"Oh dear, JHS."
Fairmile, Greenfield ,"JHS, Do you actually know what is meant by ""heir""?"
Stu64325, key west,He's clueless
Spocks-dad, London,"Who knows Charles always came across as bit lazy and looks like its catching up with him , did a bit of polo ages ago , not sporty same as @ndrew ."
Coc Caled, Bannau Brycheiniog,He is a workaholic according to most biographers.
Spocks-dad, London,"Not in good shape though ,  too much drinking and his fingers show that ."
Nimmbar, scunthorpe,Many countries will become a republic therefore less travel overseas and therefore less of a work load.  The king recognises this hence a slimmed down monarchy 
Lee Dunn, Glasgow,"Hes a bad temper old 8u gger, but william is not any better"
Misty G, Cotton,Charles won't abdicate.
Dons1983, Aberdeen,Why is Murray always photographed with her spectacles at the end of her nose?
Spocks-dad, London,Trying to look intelligent .
Busstop, Christchurch,"Would be better if at least we had a democratic vote every five years over which member of the RF we want as our Monarch and a written Constitution. If not ditch the whole lot, grow a pair and organise a proper alternative to this historical ultra geriatric process thats reaching the end of its usefullness."
Coc Caled, Bannau Brycheiniog,Malaysia changes King's ever five years. 10 different local monarchs take turns. Let's have a coronation or a presidential inauguration + perhaps a presidential election every 5 years. That will be far less expensive and more stabilizing than one every couple of decades! NOT
anteater, London,Malaysia's changes are based upon it's states. How would we manage that for heavens sake.
allied murica, kansas,He does look quite frail .
linda mcavoy, Kent,He just looks tired he will bounce back he needs to rest like most of us do after being so busy 
Chaz5446, Nottinghamshire,They were saying that about the Queen 30 yrs ago. 
bluefire, Kent,"You don't get a choice, that's the way hereditary monarchys work. "
allied murica, kansas,where do you keep your head ?   He can abdicate .
bluefire, Kent,I'll type this slowly cos you're obviously a bit dense. It's purely a hereditary monarch's choice as to how long they serve. Yes he could abdicate but surely even in your brain addled state you can see that that's his choice and no one else gets a say. 
Dave, Wakefield,He's worn out! Written in his face.
Pensioner58, Wigan,The King was early not the Wales late.
The Candy man, Scotland,He won't last six years.
Dulchie, THE REPUBLIC,He won't give it up until the very end.
zippi, Manchester,"Jenni, he's a healthy male, not a post menopausal overwieght retiree with outdated feminism ideals"
Emily, West Mids,Charles looks healthy? His fingers don't agree with you for a start
mslilyrose, Daventry,He will dismantle the monarchy. He hates the job.
pewpla, Malmesbury,"If Biden can be US president then Charles can most certainly fulfill his duties being fitter, and FAR more mentally able. He has been trained his whole life for the job and is well used to dealing with the strains and stresses of the job."
allied murica, kansas,"Please do not compare him to our president .  Our president is deplorable in every way -  demented ,  no integrity ,"
ElTel Clerkenwell , North London forever,I say he'll give us a decade and put in place what's needed for wills to be a great king and make sure the monarchy is relevant as time goes on
Maid2B, Timbuktu,"After waiting in the wings for so long, I doubt Charles will hand over to William anytime soon!!"
hellsbells, london,Ridiculous article (again) - he had been practicing all week every day for that ceremony - you would look weary & frail after that.
allied murica, kansas,"that could be the reason ,,  but we shall see .   "
Happy lad, Sheffield,Does this mean we are going to have to stump up another 200 million for another coronation
allied murica, kansas,"eventually ,.........  so whenever .............  what's the difference when ?"
dobby the elf, reading,"Ridiculous,  he can't as he's taken an oath to God and the country and is made of the stuff that won't let him even consider abdication, only older people will understand this. Harry's choices are made because of the young woke epidemic.  No backbone, no self discipline, just wailing entitlement"
Alamo Vyann, Suffragette City,He looked on the verge of tears.  Overcome with emotion at the most demanding spiritual occasion in his life
Warmincyprus, Paphos,"He's waited 70 years and his mother had to die before he got the job, no surprise that it was a very emotional ceremony for him."
Applegarth, Oxford,I'm 75 and agreed I don't have the same schedule as Charles but I am still full of energy and zest for life. 10 years of Charles will be good for the nation and good for William our King in training. Perhaps if Jenni slimmed down she would feel more up for it.
KateVale, Wales,Lol
lucky ludo, WESTON-SUPER-MARE,"I really don't think  Charles will get to 80. It would be best to have a year as King then hand over to William, then he can have an easier life. However, what do we know. He has waited a long time.  The late Queen suspected there would be trouble and carried on even with cancer. A tough well repected lady."
BeRent, NoneYa business,"Right, because cosplay is such an arduous job "
A Trusting Soul, Stour by the Sea,A bit early to give King Charles the DCM (don't come Monday)
Tiddlesmcduck, South East,Mid 70s is a ridiculous age to suddenly take on a high profile role like this. I don't have any issue with Charles but he should have stepped aside & let William do the job. It's all about Kate & William these days anyway.
Warmincyprus, Paphos,That's not how Monarchy works.
allied murica, kansas,"I just hope that Charles and camilla do not expect William and Catherine to take up their duties .  Bring on a few more royals to take up the slack ........  like Beatrice and Eugenia , or Princess Anne's son ..........  or Margaret's daughter .  William and Catherine can not keep the schedule they have been doing .  It is not right to expect them to do so"
lilaleigh, Boston,"Its probably a bit unfair to judge Charles so soon.  Yes, he is exhausted.  He lost his mother, has been hounded to death by his son who has done interviews, tv programs, and a book about how horrible the monarchy is, and now he had taken over from his beloved mother.  Time will tell, but to bet against him seems unfair.  He waited a long time and did his duty.  At least give him a fair chance."
Mobo55, Narnia,I don't give him that long if he continues to get involved in politics.  He is like Welby woke and out of touch.  And I have served and consider myself a monarchist 
redhead, London,I agree - he is really annoying me with his wokish behaviour and the Government cannot allow it.  
Marielle, Fontenay-sous-Bois ,King Charles is alright but the organisation of his Coronation made him tired. 
icancu, Birmingham,"Six years?
He could do an awful lot of damage in six years!"
North of the border , Towards the East ,"He actually has no power, politicly or otherwise. So how do you claim it will be a problem"
IceCold1975, London,"as usual, know nothing."
Lesley Fisher, Perth,"I'm 73,couldn't cope with all they do.He looks 80 at least.I give him 3 years max then we can have William at last."
PT07, Middlesex,Don't need the monarchy best they just pack up and go back to their ancestors in Germany.
Applegarth, Oxford,What about Scotland poppet.
Xcaliber21, Chicago,There are Nostradamus / Psychic predictions that he will only last 2 years.  It will be interesting to see how long he can last.
salutations, Intomeisee,I give him 6 months. He was warned that if he dont give the crown to william then the people will destroy the royal family. I cant wait. The queen Elizabeth was the only true ruler. 
Flossie, Harrow,"Jennifer Murray, I normally concur with your views, I am around your age with similar political leanings but I take issue with your article about the arrest of Graham Smith and members of the Republic group. We are heading down a slippery slope when the police try to silence anyone who disagrees with the majority. We do not live in China or Russia. In a democratic society voices of dissent should not be silenced. "
Starbs78, Rotherham,"They were not silenced. The police intercepted messages from that graham smith where they had plans to scare the horses amongst other things. As you can imagine this is dangerous for the public, the horse and the soldier. Again, people dont do their due diligence and just spout nonsense."
Cecilia, South Coast,He won't do that. He will follow the example set by his mother. 
Sadie58, Rainy lane,Camila won't be happy 
Warmincyprus, Paphos,Sadie58 - The Queen knows what she signed up for.
Photoreceptor, Sussex,Harry and family must come back to help the Monarch. Sophie and Ann are tired and old as well.
Visitingmartian, Visits Byron Bay NSW,Why would they help an institution they're trying to destroy?
allied murica, kansas,they would never because of the angst between the two brothers and the two wives.  Besides meghan would never take second place ........  there is no place for a co-queenship
vrd291247, london,"Stressful few days mate ,give the king a chance ,anyway its JUST your opinion "
ameremortal, london,Not of any importance
c.u.london, lakeside,"That sounds about right for this lot. So what's that work out to then, fifty mill a year for just for his coronation"
Starbs78, Rotherham,"Probably but then it brought it minimum one billion for the economy. The coronation costed approx 1.40 per person and it brought the country together (except the miserable negative so and sos) and brought billions to the economy benefitting profit for businesses, jobs and so much more."
Spocks-dad, London,Be nice King William V would drop the markles like a hot stone .
Cecilia, South Coast,That would be great. What wouldn't be so great is that the loathsome David Beckham will get his knighthood. The Beckham's are big buddies with Kate and Will.
ameremortal, london,I think that's already sorted
Mrs Hermann, Exeter,His mother did it well into her later years Charles needs to get some exercise and vitamins into him 
linvin, doncaster,Not as weary as we are of forking out for all of this
Starbs78, Rotherham,Give it a rest. Youre so ill-informed. The coronation cost the British public just 1.40 per person and it brought billions into the economy. Look at the bigger picture. And stop being a misery!
Marion Tanner, Sandown,"You fell for the lies then,  hopefully  more intelligent  people will rise up"
mugglewhp, Newton,He did say the ceremony was boring!  
ameremortal, london,No that was his five year old grandson
janedoe , east coast,Well the queen was frail but still carried on and isn't a monarch for life? Such nonsense.
ameremortal, london,When your every whim and fancy is catered for we would all probably live till our mid nineties
Anthony 63, London,Jenni seems to be forgetting that Charles and Camilla do virtually noting for themselves - right down to servants putting toothpaste on his toothbrush for him.......  If he goes to Australia and New Zealand he will have a bed on the UK's Government jet - he won't be slumming it in economy - working in his 70s for Charles is nothing like most people working!
Starbs78, Rotherham,You have no idea do you? They work incredibly hard and we would be in a much worse position if we didnt have them. Just educate yourself more and look at the wider picture.
Applegarth, Oxford,"Nothing Anthony, nothing."
Tosh09, South West,And you would look weary if you had done once ounce of what he has done since announcing  his Coronation 
Marion Tanner, Sandown,!!@
JustFacts945, London,Anyone else get the alert fot the bank of E putting up the intrest rates? The coronation money is looking very useful right now

No comment, cardiff,I don't dislike Charles but he should have thought more carefully about this taking his age into consideration and have treated the nationas as his #1 priority and thereby graciously  handed the Crown to William his son. 
Garth70, South of England,"That's not how it works though. He'll be King until he dies, like his mum or is unable to continue like Philip."
larrydo2, Manchester,He will do exactly like his mum did
AnonymousNY212, NY,Finally someone speaking the truth without trying to make this man out to be fit. He looked miserable. He should have given it to William in the first place.
Starbs78, Rotherham,He didnt look miserable he was incredibly emotional. Do you have any social skills at all? Cant you pick up on this?
Tiddlesmcduck, South East,Egg- it works exactly like that you plum.

getoutthefridgeboris, windsor,what would you know?
AnonymousNY212, NY,Yet you all seem to agree when its a nice thing being said about him.
IOW Dave, Isle of wight,And the lizards can pay for their own coronation next time.
Jatoas, Bedford,The Coronation cost 100m The estimated benefit to the economy was 10bil. So your statement does not hold water!
Garth70, South of England,"Another conspiracy loon. Events like the coronation generate millions for the UK economy, it was estimated the coronation generated around a billion, and Meghan and Harry's wedding around 1.5 billion, that's additional to the annual revenue generated by the royals of almost 2 billion. Google Brand Research for more info"

Sherlock Rose, Cambridge,William is absolutely NOT hated. 
MD, Scotland,Five weeks would be preferable.
General Gordon, Khartoum,"I agree most people in their seventies would find it hard going having to do what Charles is going to have to do . But then most seventy somethings don't have loads of servants and people to attend to 'ones' every need and whim , whilst having the best of everything laid on for them ."
Jatoas, Bedford,Do you really believe the tosh that you just wrote?
Tezzab, Gilberdyke,I am in my mid seventies and still do my gardening and house decorating so your remark is a load of balderdash. 
LoopyTheLou, Beirut,No no no
Margaret, Ottawa,The Princess Royal:  best monarch we shall never have.  Pity.
EdwynTheGay, Mouse Island,Charles will live to be 116. He will never abdicate ^^

tisonlyme 46, London,"Where do you think the money ""we have to pay for"" goes? It works its way back into the economy, it doesn't disappear into thin air."
p2244a, london,   his been annointed  .. he cannot abdicate!  that's why the queen couln't
Dev971, Notts,"Two adulterers, soon to be anointed with ""holy oil"" in a ceremony costing the country hundreds of millions!?! Was more farcical than a carry on film"
tisonlyme 46, London,"@Dev971, the coronation may have cost millions but it generated billions."
Milfbanger, Crawley,Look at the state of them 
Britannia172, Ely,"Just for comparison, let's see the state of you"
Milfbanger, Crawley,Loool nothing wrong with me plenty wrong with them 
Spocks-dad, London,"Kings and Queens rarely abdicate , its what they are built up for in their life , then think its their duty until their last breath ."
Blueladder, Rougnac,he stinx
mywifemademedoit, Sheffield,No a snowballs is he going to abdicate. You don't wait 74 years for a job and give it up after a couple. 
Wee Annie, Cockermouth,"Coming from a garlic stinking nation , that's laughable!!"
preggoteen, Falkirk,Nonsense. Leave giving up to the dutch and Spanish 
Pez22, Letchworth,He will die in office.
alderton10, Sydney,Charlie - va 'ferocious work ethic'. That's hilarious DM.  Who writes these gags for you.
Aloysius1953, Birmingham,"Weary! He's never had a proper job, so he doesn't qualify for being ""weary""!"
Jatoas, Bedford,Commander of a mine sweeper was a proper job when I last looked!!!
wrinkly reader2, Tiverton,"Of course he looks tired.  Who wouldn't?  Rehearsing for an incredible pageant for several weeks, the emotion of taking centre stage at one of the most important occasions of his life, whilst worrying about the rest of his family - especially how his younger son was likely to behave; staying out  and visiting so many of the celebration sites during the weekend........ I feel knackered just writing about it!   I cannot see Jenni Murray managing to do even half of those things without a large g & t to hand - and he would not be able to take even that!"
Realistalways, West midlands,"They don't retire, they carry on till their last breath."
Spocks-dad, London,And you give Charles 6 years because of an easy story today .
james, tunbridge wells,"Thought he basically looked miserable and don't think she really wants the job either, but trapped like automata in their own gilded  cages."
bluebeanie, Wirral,"Spot on Jenny, I thought he looked Knackered and his youngest son and his Harpie , haven't helped in the slightest to ease the burden,  in fact they have added to it ."
Caroline, Scotland,And what about the oldest son who is only now beginning to work?
Patricia Kidd, Wrexham,Don't be so ridiculous!!!
YORKIE -York, York,"Poor man looked ill, tired,  and exhausted at his coronation He needs a good holiday with his wife, away from everyone, just peace and quiet,and relaxation. I am sure he will then be able to carry on with his duty with a spring in his step and his loving wife by his side."
Pumori73, Perth,@YORKIE - WE ALL need good holidays and rest Pal but cannot afford to do so ...WORK to survive and pay the bills .....have the others gone for a GOOD REST as not seen from yesterday?
lordarzal, Arzal,"Just the sort of king Britain needs, petulant because his son and heir was unavoidably delayed. Somebody must have put his toothpaste on the wrong way round. "
Peanuts10, Somewhere in Essex,Remember seeing him not happy about an ink well on his table - not happy then and not now. Expects everything perfect and waited on hand and foot and hell will break loose if not. 
Thought_, Shannon,Murray clutching at straws to choose a random guess in order to get an article published!
Realistalways, West midlands,"I was just thinking exactly the same. Also, as she wrote on here herself she was glad her Ukrainian guests had gone back. Now she's missing them?"
Pumori73, Perth,Yep-trying hard to sway for the others to become highly prominent and push Chuck & Millie out!
Cestius, Wellingborough,So be it. Some older kings have had short (but relatively successful reigns). William IV lasted 7 years and Edward VII about 9 years. And I might live to see the coronation of William V (or whoever fate might decree) in a few years.
Mashatu, London,"6 years? This is said by the lady who looks older and more tired than Queen Camilla.
"
Spocks-dad, London,6 years would be nearly a forgotten King in RF history like William IV .
johns-girl, Bristol,He was very funny in Blackadder though.
The Topics, General Santos City,That's being generous... this whole thing should be abolished. We are not living in the 19th century anymore. Should have ended when the old lady passed.
Brainstormzy, Guildford,Oh play another record will you. What benefit to you is the removal of the British Monarchy and its replacement with a very expensive president?
mzcant, Sydney,He should retire he had his day now time to move on and give William and Kate a go.
Pumori73, Perth,@mzcant- WHY? Chuck is a good man and he was made to wait for over 50 years to be on the Throne ....maybe he will break records as well -give him credit for his patience
Caroline, Scotland,No. I will become anti monarchist the moment Charles goes. Wm has only recently started to do some work and Katie still normally does vetynlite.
Very_Rusty, Online,The late Queen managed to bear up well into her 90s.  The support she needed was in place - just as it is for Charles.
Nausikaa, Melbourne,Tosh!
Bartletts, London,I give him 300 days!
poisongirl57, Dover,"I hope not. He's waited all his life for this and I hope he lives long enough to enjoy it. I doubt he would abdicate anyway, he will do his duty until he dies just as his mother did."
BeBeel, Nottingham,"Expect William will do most of the' heavy lifting' then without being Crowned, just like his father did for the late Queen. Just because it wasn't seen, doesn't mean it didn't happen."
Caroline, Scotland,William does half the engagements Charles does.
Allie WR, North Norfolk Coast,Charles remaining on the throne will be dependent on how long Camilla lives. She's a smoker and will not out live Charles. Her death will sadly finish him off. He won't want to live years without his soul mate.
Allie WR, North Norfolk Coast,It's called having and expressing an opinion just like you have with my comment.
Tezzab, Gilberdyke,Camilla gave up smoking when she married Charles. 
David, Manchester England,The good news for the nation is that (like his Mother before him) there is no way on earth Charles III will abdicate the throne to William. 
Getting Fedup, Now,The anti-christ will not hand over until he has completed his WEF duties
WAissafe, Perth,Oh dear. Forgotten to take your pills again?
JustFacts945, London,Please someone tell me the point of the RF? I want genuine valid points please 
Mind-the___Gap, Bristol,"They generate hundreds of millions of pounds, if not more, for the country annually. They provide a focus and symbol for many other countries who also benefit in economic and social terms from their association with the royal family (e.g. the commonwealth - isnt just the UK giving away to everyone, it is a functioning support mechanism for many of the smaller countries to assist each other) . They generate support and funding for hundreds, if not thousands of charities. They deliver real direct support for key charities where they are not only a patron but a regular and active patron, such as the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. And a heck of a lot of people like them - which is nice in itself. How is that?"
BeBeel, Nottingham,They stop us ending up with someone like Trump being head of the Nation.
Batame458, Beal Feirste,He'd probably prefer to retire to his garden for the rest of his life and not be bothered by anyone. He's a stereotypical grumpy old best left alone.
null, 5 hours ago,"So JM wouldn't be tired.......yeah give me a break.  He's just been crowned and the speculation starts, I remember reading over 20 years ago how the Queen would abdicate.  Give it a rest, push your glasses back on your nose (or get a pair that fits properly).  Looking at the politicians  around today worldwide give me our system any time."
JustFacts945, London,The royal family playing dress up again. Basically a moving madame tusauds show.  
Shakemeister, Yorkshire,Unfortunately I think the King may have heart issues. His face and this notorious finger issue hints at it. A good photo of his fingernails would also provide some hints about his health. He doesn't seem to have any serious mobility or intellectual issues though.
WAissafe, Perth,He can afford the best doctors and the best healthcare. It would be sad if they can't sort out any health problems he has. 
MagalufTony, Magaluf and Bolton,He should abolish the monarchy and do us all a favor. Not my king. I will be heading down to London this weekend to join the protestors 
Tezzab, Gilberdyke,If you don't like it go and live in a republic. 
Decorum, Region Lemanique,I respect your decsion not to accept him as your King.  But why do you not respect those who do?  There is room in our society for both positions.
Lou, Guildford,"Yes, Charles will be tired - understandably.  Besides, he is prickly, petulant and likes things to go smoothly with the least inconvenience to him.  He hasn't the late Queen's extraordinary self-discipline and stamina.  She stopped travelling abroad in her mid-80s, leaving it to other RF members to represent her.  Perhaps Charles will eventually do the same."
Magazine, Madrid,Dont think William is much different. 
Lou, Guildford,"Magazine, Madrid ---- You could be right.  Been reported, more than once, that William can get into a filthy temper when things don't go his way or as he expects."
KITOLI, Oversan,"Hopefully there will be no monarchy in six years time. The coronation highlighted the absurdity of this medieval circus. Disband the nonsensical gravy train and return all the stolen land, castles and wealth to the nation. "
Mind-the___Gap, Bristol,"They never belonged to the nation and, in fact, it is only with the largesse of the monarchy that they now are held in trust, and generate income for the nation. And the crown cannot steal its own land, as a matter of trite common law all land is owned by the Crown. So just once will a  republican please get something correct?"
Alamo Vyann, Suffragette City,Love this.  The Crown has eminent domain over everything! 
tayop, london,does anyone really think Camilla will allow Charlie boy to give up 110m annual salary?? that probably can only happen if William is her son
Spocks-dad, London,Still think Charles would beat you in a 100 metre race Jenni .
CrazyChickenLady69, Birmingham,Saggy baggy tired face  = result of a pampered and cosseted lifestyle  ....
Janet, North Buckinghamshire,Charles or Jenni?
CrazyChickenLady69, Birmingham,Both  ..
Unpopulist, London.,So soon. We can't afford another coronation that quickly.
JJherself, Northampton,When Camilla dies he'll hand over to his son and retreat to Highgrove. She's not destined to be long lived like him. She's actually looking older.
PrincePotemkin, LONDON,Weary? The feeling is mutual -
lizzyb, Boca Raton Fl. USA,"I was so shocked at how old he looks. At this rate, he will certainly not live as long as his parents."
TopMan92, Peterborough,"He will not hand it over he will cling on to it and it will have to be pryed from his dead hands, as his mother did before him"
Gerry wolf, Antrim,Yeah and cost us how much more again? If it happens there needs to be cut backs
Diana, London,"Please just give it a rest - all this speculation with unfounded assumptions!
If people actually looked at history none of this is new
Lets just give them a chance?"
Big Rich, Yorkshire,Don't be so delusional- there's more chance of me becoming King than of Charles stepping aside.....let's give him chance before we decide if he isn't up to it.....
Scotland666, Edinburgh,"If he continues his woke climate nonsense, there will not be a crown to pass to William. "
WAissafe, Perth,"""woke climate nonsense""!! Good job we don't all listen to people like you!"
Poppy Clarke, inthesticks,If  Charles had any consideration for the people he would have stepped back and let William  be king  The vast expense of his coronation when the people are struggling so hard shows just how out of touch he is with the real world
Caroline, Scotland,William doesn't like work.
Bennie24, WIRRAL,"William most certainly doesnt like work, nor does Saint Waitie, although according to the Media her every move, gesture, facial expression is sweet and adorable.  William is as petulant as his father, inclined to bad temper when he doesnt get his way, and so it would appear is Waitie"
David..., England,"The Queen and Prince Philip were working well i to their 90's, he won't walk away early unless he has a major health scare."
Fanny Adams, London,No way he will be King until death  and then William will take over If you had a schedule like the kings you would look exhausted  Heavy is the head who wears the crown  God save King Charles
Faircupboris, manchester,"if that is the case go now and save us the cost of another dreary coronation, or are we too late for that?"
faolan, Bedford,There was nothing dreary about it. Did you actually watch it? Thought not.
Karen, In the garden,What a ridiculous headline! 
sgb, England,6 years? He's waited 74. There's no way he'll give up a day of it now he's King. 
JJherself, Northampton,"Age makes changes none of us foresee..l'm 78, trust me, l've changed drastically physically in the last six years..Knowing when to listen to your body iand not the hype of fashion, is not giving up, it's wisdom. No amount of slap can hide the truth forever."
Love Actually, Somewhere in the North,"Charles may well have been very nervous at the Coronation, who wouldn't be with the world all watching, that makes you a little bit tetchy to say the least.  As for the trip to Australia, my father has done it 4 times since his 80th Birthday, the last time being just 3 yrs ago at the age of 92.   Charles has waited many years to be King, he will not give that up easily,  we know how stoic the Queen was, even with cancer at the end."
judi21, somewhere,"Charles has more health problems than the Queen did, and it's a couple of years since he handed much of the Duchy running to William, so that Charles could help lessen the load on the Queen more. Charles was 50 when he started taking some of his mother's workload, and strangely it really helped his relationship with his father,as Charles sought his advice more.
I can't see him giving up completely but William will be doing exactly what he did probably from now, or very soon. I think William taking the reins in Cornwall was what made his relationship with Harry worse, as he essentially began to control the money Harry was given. Having said that Harry said it was Charles that refused to pay a 3million dress bill, AFTER  paying for all wedding costs. I think Harry thought they would just split the Duchy for some reason, not just the net profits. Maybe he realised that wouldn't happen after William was PofW.
I'm not sure Charles will live much past 80, but I hope he does,if only for Geor"
pam1696, chester,That long?
Rafkiwi, Burton upon Trent,I think you would look tired if you had just gone through what he has and then you have his very nasty son on top off that
JJherself, Northampton,"Therein hangs the truth, as well as age!"
Spiritdancer, Chelmsford,"I can't see them making a success of it either, for one thing Camilla hates flying and detests hot countries, and William wont agree to go far since he is unwilling to leave his kids, even though they have nannies. Charles may have been mentally preparing for this for decades, but he always had the Queen and Duke taking centre stage. Now he has to go it alone. He already looks overtired after the coronation and has gone to Sandringham to recover. None of that bodes well for a newly crowned king. As for William taking over, he needs to mature a lot and stop sticking his heels in over everything he disagrees with before he even begins to be ready to wear a crown. "
BINA IOW, Cowes,"People like you are so ill informed. William's children do not have ""Nannies"" and never have. The only Nanny in their life is Maria Borello, and since they have moved to Adelaide Cottage, which is a small, four bedroomed home, she no longer lives with them. No-one does!"
JJherself, Northampton,"They do have a very hands on career driven granny though. Who raised a very similar daughter. Whose career as Princess of Wales is not exactly the bottom rung of her profession. And who will be further needed when her daughter's crowned as Queen, to school those three grandchildren in etiquette. She's done s good job for their mother this far."
OrthodoxMonk, Bradford,"Just another globalist N. W. O W. E. F sell-out.

Also CoE is not Christian it as been infiltrated and now follows the satanic religious sect of wokeism.

As a Wh, ite straight man I do not feel welcome in a CoE church so would never go to one.

It's about time for a christianity to return back to its original and TRUE form. Orthodoxy and Common sense, family values and morality.."
johns-girl, Bristol,"I've lived my whole life without religion but I do have morals (sorry Orthodox I'm having a bad day today, I don't want to take it out on you). I brought my daughter up to be a decent respectful person and you do know that through the years many, many innocent people have been killed and tortured in the name of Christianity?"
OrthodoxMonk, Bradford,Hello John's Girl I appreciate that thank you. I don't doubt they is good people that  live without religion. But that is mainly individuals I am talking about groups and societies as a whole. The shared learned morals that everyone learns from Christianity is very important alot of Humanist philosophy all comes from Christianity. It's just watered down. 
null, 5 hours ago,"Son or no son Charles ain't giving that up without a fight, he's gonna stay until they bury him ha ha he has waited far to king for this"
MMF , York,He just had his poor me look on his face that day.
Thirtynineplus, Dorking,I think that's just his resting face.
Michael03, Norfolk,"Oh Jenni, go and do something useful with your life. All this guessing is just a waste of time"
Spiritdancer, Chelmsford,Why? The DM do it every day.
LaDiDa, London,Alcoholic is the correct word.
SHuss, London,"10 years would take its tollboth of them just wanted the spectacle of a coronation, theyre old and in afew years be limited to duties with William taking over."
Krakenish, Berwickshire,"Jenni, you havent been listening. Charles has a 10 year plan. So he clearly intends to be king until he is 84, at least."
Flying Fox III, Carthage,Geriatric monarchy for a crumbling Britain
Michael03, Norfolk,Better than geriatric presidents
mscontroversial, Durham,They looked like a pair of bobbleheads with those crowns on.   Very difficult to take them seriously!
DiconDeconEng, Gormenghast.,"King Charles should be the last.
The 'young' royals are nothing but celebs. "
Dee, A Village,"I do not think King Charles would step aside unless Camilla died, then I think he would let William take over. But Charles may already have decided on a 5 or ten year plan?
Another alternative for Charles and Camilla would be what the Queen did for the last couple of her years and give William the reins much more, taking almost all of his and Camilla's workload, with him, Charles only authorising and signing items that can only bear the reigning Monarch's signature."
Spocks-dad, London,"A huge part of the monarchy went with the Queen and Prince Philip , Charles and Camilla their age , history and his poor decisions go against them ."
hywel15, Newport,I think the expression on his face was like his father they don't want all the fuss and I suspect if he'd had his way there would never have been a coronation.
DiscreetCivilisation, Birmingham,"Hand over the reigns to who, Camilla?"
LM50, Dublin,"There is something called 'The line of succession', Camilla does not feature there."
johns-girl, Bristol,Reins!
Jake, Never neverland,Suddenly your Mystic Meg.  Get on with your life.
warose, Sydney,"Hi Jenny Murray.  I think any man who had a son like Harry would be weary, not to mention having a death in the family so close, like I have just lost my husband.   I think you do not take into consideration the efforts Charles has done over the last year with a six moth and a brother that has given him a hard time besides a daughter in law to boot."
Vladimir Jong-un, Kim,Elvis Presley is the King! Fact! 
Old-timer, Lincoln,Abdicate  ! 
letsusbefrank, Somewhere,"I would be surprised if he lived as long as his parents did anyway. He has looked older and in poorer health than they did at a similar age, for quite a while now. A lot may depend on Camilla as well. Given she has not led a Royal life for most of her life, then add in she smokes like a chimney, she may not reach a really really old age either. As we saw with the Queen and Philip (and so many other couples) when one goes, often the other follows, one can't exist without the other. But I don't think he'll ever abdicate. A regency maybe, but not abdication."
Tezzab, Gilberdyke,For your information Camilla gave up smoking when she married Charles 18 years ago. Get your facts right before posting. 
WiseOne2023, London,I give jenni 18 months as a journalist. 
Oneofakind-10, Kendal,I thought it looked like Charles had been crying prior to the Coronation as his eyes were puffy and red and he looked quite frail.  An awful lot to take on at his age.
Old Lucy, Stoke on Trent,"Guilty of so mayt sins all forgotten until the day dawns that he is to be crowned before his god.
"
CausticCambridge, Cambridge,Possibly he just didnt sleep well the night before.
Smartypant, Hamilton,They look bloomin ridiculous ....
Big Yin, London,He didn't look at all well on Coronation Day .....very pale.  He perked up after a couple of days.
usher2512, London,I think he was wearing make up to make his face less red.
Dottie2, Parallel Universe ,"Yes I thought he looked ill and older than his years, camillia wasn't genuinely happy, seemed staged. At one point I thought he was going to have a coronary. Also I thought those events were rehearsed? Neither of them seemed to have a clue what was coming next "
Sniveser, St Ives,i think all the emotional pain that harry has given his father has taken a huge toll on charles' health.
Old Lucy, Stoke on Trent,Now he perhaps knows how his parents felt when he caused them so much heartache.
anteater, London,I'm sure you're right.
intrepid56, Winterfell,Charles = woke halfwit!
TonyTCClark, Herts,The monarchy should've ended with the Queens passing on!!
AuContraireMonAmi, The Tundra,I'm rather hoping he'll be the last one.
Alamo Vyann, Suffragette City,He'd win
AuContraireMonAmi, The Tundra,And that's fine as long as he'd been voted for. Then we get another vote 5 years after that and so on.
Bungalow Ballz, Mumbai,He will be fine. The previous week was very busy because of such huge events. It is almost summer and time for the royal vacation in Scotland. 
Little__Bird, Palm Beach,"I don't think he'll willingly step aside - not from something he's waited his whole life for.  William isn't ready to be King yet, and Kate needs to ramp up her work before becoming Queen.  I'd like to see Anne and Bea have more prominent roles."
WiseOne2023, London,Nothing to do with you! 
judi21, somewhere,"Princess Anne does more work than even Charles, so I can't quite see how you can expect her to do more. Beatrice never wanted to be a working royal, unlike her sister. She quietly does a lot of charity work, particularly with dyslexia charities, and has done since she was a student to my personal knowledge. I think now Beatrice has a young family,, abd Eugenie and Jack are talking about relocation to the US, Edwards family are more likely to step into the breech that will appear if Williams children go to uni or into forces training. Catherine would have being doing more from this year anyway as her children are now at school,, as that was the deal that Harry claimed he and William made with the Queen, to avoid the situation thrust onto Charles and Anne when the Queen became the monarch. It's also why their children went on tours with them both. Charles took on a lot of the Queens responsibilities from 50 yrs old and I expect William will do the same in the next couple of years, if he"
icemaiden71, Over There,Be careful what you wish for. He looks lost in thought and not at all happy
AnnaSew, Sutton Coldfield,I like Camilla.  But watching her stand at the concert and wave a flag I have to say - yes - she looked spaced out - in fact the image that came up sadly was of a care home dementia resident taking part in group activity in a care home.   Like she had no clue what she was doing.
Lesley Fisher, Perth,On tranquilisers for the day probably.
anteater, London,She did her back in just before the Coronation so was probably on strong pain killers.
tom mix, bermingham,News flash Charles has already hinted he will step down in favour of William & Kate in 10 years time .
Bella DiGris, Worle,"When and where did he ""hint"" this?"
Caroline, Scotland,Ummm. Kate will not be a monarch and she barely works.
Wheatfromchaff, Peterborough,He will be King as long as Biden was President.
me, here,i agree .. king until 2029 is the date i found too .. 
cache23, London,"I expect Charles to abdicate after about 10 years. He would still be known as King Charles, but William would be the monarch. Elizabeth herself should have abdicated. Everyone has the right to retire, including monarchs. "
Bella DiGris, Worle,"If he abdicated he would not be known as King Charles because abdicating means giving up the throne. A Regency might work, or simply having William take on more of the day-to-day work."
cache23, London,"Why shouldn't Charles still be known as a King? If he were to die now, his wife would still be Queen Camilla and his daughter-in-law would be Queen Kate (or Catherine). "
jetdefloor, upnorth,Omg as long as 6?
HolyJeremiahXI, London,He finally got what he wanted 
Straightothecomments, London,Have you looked in the mirror? Kettle black?
MAGhunter, Mao a Lago,Unemployed nepo baby tired of sitting around being welfare king.  Ok
Denygenus, Berkshire,"Well,  my  partner and I are in our late fifties, and we are slowing down, let alone being in your seventies! Alcohol and rich food wise, almost non-existent. Especially alcohol. I don't like the effects of it now. Charles looks like a big drinker, too. The puffy sausage fingers and his fatigued expression are telling. Camilla looks frail. I will definitely see another coronation in my lifetime. "
Wheatfromchaff, Peterborough,"Let's see how C fairs at the In ter national, Com mon L aw Court.   Check out the 2013 case Nr 1."
Tito Rand, Reunion Island,whos this Jenni person?...and how did you get your superpowers that enables you to claim how long which king...or queen...of a country reigns?...what about you?...when will you be leaving?...
Iggyxx, UK,"Most of the writers base their articles on speculations and opinion, very little on fact. Although, depending on the topic or subject, they are often taken as fact, especially when its something people want to believe to be true."
NotMyKing, Nowhere,6 months until there's widespread protests and he's forced to stand down.
Twit, IOS,I would have thought anyone would be looking tried after the stress of the Coronation process.  The King wad looking much younger just days after the Coronation.  This women needs to put a gag in it. 
WinterFrost, Risby,"If he loves his country, he and his adulterous wife, should do a Queen Victoria and exile themselves to Osborne House on the IoW. Of course they would have to chuck all the grace n favour tenants out first, mainly retired ex forces senior stuffers. Perhaps he will do this anyway when he finds out how many are still sucking on the test of plenty that is mainly from the tax payer and his pocket."
SaoPaulo, London,They should've packed this all in when the Queen passed
David, Manchester England,"Oh please God no! I'm hoping Charles will see me out, his prospect of living through 'The William & Katie Show' fills me with dread!"
leighlad1, leigh,thas talking carp woman
Jezza51, Newbold verdon,Fishy ?
palava, London,Six years!! I gave him 20 years being generous with time
Joe Francis, Wells,"Nobody likes Charles, even the most ardent royalists.  A quiet ""you're looking tired, sir, perhaps you should step down?"" campaign is obviously kicking off, but its advocates may be disappointed.  Despite the ferocious ""William for king"" agenda, I think you're all going to find in time that, unlike Harry, William is a chip off the old block."
RobertLessant, London,Plenty like Charles. Unfortunately he suffers from comparison bias against one of the greatest monarchs the world has ever seen.
mancunian, Oswestry,"YOU dont like the King, but dint presume to speak for anybody else."
sky58, Uk,Wouldn't you be tired??? He's probably had no sleep all night !! 
The-undead, Nowhere Ville,I doubt he was up Camilla all night...
Reallyhmm, Horsham,i think he will die King.  I think he wants to shield William as long as possible for he has to take on the role and let William train for the role and be a family man for as long as possible
The-undead, Nowhere Ville,Train? Are you having a laugh.
LM50, Dublin,"For me, Prince William is ready now. "
Fluffyrock, Somewhere,"William and Kate weren't late, Charles carriage was early, this was confirmed by Westminster Abbey. I said to my sister last night Charles looked frail. I hope he gets a few years as he waited so long to be King."
Caroline, Scotland,William and Kate WERE late. They would still have arrived two minutes after Charles even if Charles had been on time. They are apparently late for everything.
MichaelHF, Coventry,More Murray rubish
MargaretMarkham, Birmingham,"I am in my late 70s and certainly could not do what the king and queen will do. Also, I would love to see William crowned, he and Catherine will be brilliant. I don't wish Charles I'll so yes, please hand over in the next few years."
Caroline, Scotland,William and especially Kate will have to up their work rate. People dont get how hard Charles works.
tilaam, northants,Tbh I thought he wouldn't do it and we'd go straight to william
Spocks-dad, London,"Not sure if he will reign until he dies , would like to see William and Kate King and  Queen while in their early fifties ."
Myth Buster, London,Remembering Diana :(
express, bristol,He hasn't waited his whole life for this. He never wanted to be king. He's just doing his duties.  But he will make a good king. Charlie likes walking in the Highlands of Scotland best away from it all. He said this years ago. 
Horse Life, Chipping Norton,The WEF King is no friend to the people of the UK.
Wheatfromchaff, Peterborough,"Endures we the people a few days a year for our Tax, more like."
Caz68, Pembrokeshire,He'll rule for the next ten years until William & Kate's children have grown. So they are not denied a proper upbringing like he was when our Queen had to become monarch after her father's death.
ShopAssistant, Port Talbot,"I was thinking something similar, but probably more like fifteen years until Louis is twenty and is at university or able to carry out duties as a working Royal. I don't think that King Charles would want to inflict the same sort of childhood that he had onto his grandchildren."
argus4545, Lincoln,"If he does six years, that will let William and Kate have some time with their family. Only hope that he will resist the urge to be Charles the Meddler. Let's face it, the Queen is an impossible act to follow."
BG, Shropshire,"He won't resist the urge, he's already had his say on these illegals. He should remember what happened to his famous namesake from meddling in Parliament."
ShopAssistant, Port Talbot,"Louis is only just turned five, he would only be eleven in six years, I think that another ten to fifteen years would be better for him"
Faircupboris, manchester,"extraordinary genes,. more like a totally pampered life with ever illness however slight treated by experts and the rest of the country suffering with a tory run down NHS"
Haglet, Cheltenham,"The NHS has been declining for years before the Tories took charge. I know, I worked in it for long enough. It hasnt been safe in the hands of any government, for a very long time."
LM50, Dublin,'Tory run down NHS' what does that even mean? I swear some Northerners you'd be surprised if they can read and write. 
Runpol, Warsaw,It's a good thing that he's king because he would never pass the selection process for any real job.
LM50, Dublin,Considering he served in The Royal Navy and The Royal Airforce and has a degree from Cambridge I can't see why not.
Gary, Stoke,"Serving 'RAF fighter pilot' ..really? when was that then? He also got his Army para wings without even doing the gruelling 'P Company' - imagine him doing the 'milling' phase! - nor the full quota of jumps so what real value was that either? As for the Navy and Cambridge submissions, how many (non) royals would have even passed the paper sift for either role with the (exact) same academic qualifications he got waved through with? Why do these myths and revisionists of them achieving anything to do with the military or academia on merit (but less Anne's accepted equestrian achievements) still persist?"
NoSheepNo, Somewhere,They ALL need to disappear ! Republic NOW !
mancunian, Oswestry,"What kind of Republic do you want?  I keep asking that question,  it no-one answers.  Russia,  North Korea, Trump, Biden, Macron TELL US!"
tomkent, Somewhere in England,Ireland?
lily, London,Hopefully  he will abdicate and take Camilla with him 
Spocks-dad, London,i think 11 will want to beat Edward VII .
Easterly, Chicago,"Due to Charles age, there is a good chance his reign will serve as a sort of placeholder for William. He wont reign anywhere nearly as long as QE II, and the stress of actually becoming King may take a toll on him, so he is fortunate to have Anne, William, and Edward to lean on."
Caroline, Scotland,William has only recently started to work but this has gone unnoticed by the great British Public.
fishkeeper, Canterbury,He has waited his whole life for this. He isn't going to give it up in six years.
Tshuks, London,The country can't afford to spend another 250 million pounds within 6 years.... his father lived to a hundred.....
LM50, Dublin,"You'll find the UK is a very wealthy country, people can't seem to get that through their heads. 250million is a drop in the Ocean."
fancytail, Penzance,Won't happen .. he will do what his mother did and rule until he dies.
Mark, Wellaway,"The psychic community have him down for 3 years, the only debate is whether he will abdicate or pass over."
Bella DiGris, Worle,"The entire ""psychic community""? I'd be amazed if they could agree on what day of the week it is, never mind how long the King will reign."
Tshuks, London,"Is it true then what Harry said, Royals leaking stories on each other....we need names....."
LM50, Dublin,"Harry doesn't speak in truths, he speaks Meghanese."
anteater, London,It sounds like Harry's truth rather than the real truth.
deepgreenforest, gurabaii,6 years? Really? Like in Agenda 2030 6 years (approximately)? Ok then. 
pay-gann, Saltaire,What qualifies you to make assessments about his health or length of service?
Dianaismyqueen, London,"He was tired from wearing crown, his fingers are all swollen and Camillas head was shaking. They are too old and weak for service obviously."
johns-girl, Bristol,Everyone is entitled to an opinion.
blaise_o_trail, Dublin,"This was one of those Phil Space pieces, frankly. The king is on the record as abdication sceptic, noting that it dilutes the mystique of monarchy."
lily, London,If he imagines there is any mystique left to the monarchy he has mental health issues.
Angela, London,"Jenni, when your face is in repose you look tired. Its all down-to old age. Everything about our faces droops as we get older"
Easterly, Chicago,"I think Anne and William will be tremendous assets to Charles. Even though he has had a lifetime to prepare for the role of being King, it still has to be quite a responsibility to take on in his mid-70s following a stellar reign by his mother. QE II is going to be a tough act to follow. I hope the Sussexes do not interfere, but they will. Harry does Meghans bidding. They made the late Queens last years incredibly difficult and will do the same to Charles. William will deal with the Sussexes when he is King."
Irish Spirit, Sydney,Well said!
johns-girl, Bristol,The Sussexes are rapidly becoming irrelevant. I hope they have a happy life with their kids in their massive house.
lakefront, Toronto,"if he has his parents longevity genes , he will be around for 20 years.  Accept It !"
MELLOW, BRIGHTON,"Jenny, have you lost your marbles? That's the most ridiculous statement I've heard since someone nominated Putin for the Nobel peace prize."
Smythe-William, Stopperton,How on earth would she know!?
onewise, oldville,didnt you know she knows everything about everyone including you and me and everyone
Old Lucy, Stoke on Trent,She's aD>M journo they know everything about nothing.
clareleach, london,"He will not abdicate. Yes, he looks tired and weary but within 3 years he has lost his father,  his mother and has a strained difficult relationship with his youngest son who has thrown grenade after grenade at him and the RF. Charles would love to give William and Katherine more time raising their young children without the deeper responsibility of king and queen."
Smart lady, Maidstone,You are so right
toeker, flint,"He waited too long to simply give it up, I think he will die as king. And rightly so if he chooses."
Old Lucy, Stoke on Trent,I hope he has a funeral plan in place because we sure as hell can't afford another royal circus.
Estel, Oxford,If he stops taking the Valium he would be better.
Trefusis86, Norwich,Totally disagree I think he will be king until his death. 
martyfirthoffifth, Liverpool,"Think you may be right. Kings and Queens of yesteryear didn't live beyond their early to mid 80s, and didn't do the travelling and endless meetings and formal occasions of today. It's like my wife's frail parents who are in their mid 80s doing all these things, it's absolutely unthinkable "
Children5, London,King Charles won't abdicate.
Fennynelly, Shropshire,It's the only time I've seen him looking weary from press papers...he's allowed to be serious when undertaking his vows.
Spocks-dad, London,"Not really a fan of Charles and Camilla , down to William and Kate to keep main public interest in the RF ."
HALCYON DAZE, FOD,Ditto
Sam Prop, manchester,"Can we leave them alone for a while?
Don't forget, he has recently lost his mother, and that pain is no different for him than it is for anyone else.
He has made king, I bet the preparation for that was exhausting,  every detail pondered over at length.
IM not the biggest royalist in the country,  not by a long way,  however, give the bloke a chance before saying he is about to abdicate.
Carmilla, is his wife,  Again, Im not her biggest fan, and she makes him a better more rounded person.  Lets give them some time to get their heads together. "
TheCarrotParrot, East Cowes Isle of Wight,A sensible comment.
Irish Spirit, Sydney,Well said.
Rachael-Humphrey, Northamptonshire,"I believe he will serve everyone until his final day like our late Queen did. He hasn't waited all these years, broken history as the longest waiting heir to the throne in the UK to then hand over the duty to The Prince Of Wales before his time is complete. He has stated he has lots of matters he wishes to tend to while he has his position, and I believe he will do his best and you can't ask any one to do more than their best."
Alcatraz1, Tampa,Thats ridiculous
Brittunculus, Pandæmonium,"Never having to work a day in your life, being permanently on holiday, and waited on hand and foot, must be terribly wearisome. Poor chap."
Annie, Dorset,"The King looking tired is no doubt due to all the revelations that will now come out. Harry has been proved right in that it was other members of the royal family who leaked stories about him and his wife to the press, no doubt to detract the bigger stories about them! William in particular, and his extramarital activities. Look up Simon Charles Durante-Day. It cannot be hidden any longer!"
Haglet, Cheltenham,So you believe Dorante - Day? There was also a chap who claimed to be the son of  Princess Margaret. Fantasists both. As for believing anything that comes out of PHs mouth - only the gullible would believe a word that he says.
Irish Spirit, Sydney,Durante-Day! L o L !
agt, Geneva,I don't think he will abdicate unless Camilla dies before him.
WhatInTheWorld2020, Surrey,Camilla always has a vacant expression.
Jock J, Happy Valley,Bet you have too to a lot of people
clareleach, london,She appears tired and weary just like him but there has been a lot of upheaval in the RF over the last 3 years
Aine 24, Kildare,Surely People wouldn't be happy to have taxpayers paying for another coronation if he abdicated?
Spocks-dad, London,"Camilla gets tired quickly also , puffing like a good one getting off a helicopter a while back ."
Gaia Zance, Northumberland,"What a mean article about The King. Most people, whatever their age, would have found his last 8 months very stressful and tiring. He's done incredibly well. I thought he looked suitable solemn and moved by the solemnity of the coronation on Saturday. He has just promised to serve the country and the people fir the rest of his life. Perhaps the writer should spend more time artfully arranging her huge scarves that she always covers her torso up with in photos."
Bryan, West Texas,I give Jenni Murrary six weeks before she's fired from this DM columnist job.
ajh11867, Bristol,Who cares doesn't affect anyone lives in the UK whom ever is King or Queen. Unless you work for them or are in conversations with them on a daily basis.
Honey, Manchester,Yeah thanks to horrid Henry 
Flumoxed, Waterford,"He will never abdicate. He may have William carry more of the load. May even make him Regent, though I doubt it, unless due to health. He will never abdicate"
Samantha, England,"I believe this to be common knowledge,  not an ah ha moment  - 5 years and he will gracefully bow out - William,  younger and with it will take over"
Evidence, Barnsley,At least his pen didn't leak.
Incle, Devizes,It wasn't 'his' pen that leaked.
Evidence, Barnsley,Their pen?
Corrigenda, St Albans,He will follow his mother who after the Edward VIII fiasco vowed never to stand down. That issue may not be seen as so serious to us today but it most certainly still is in the RF.
Tilly2, Gloucester,Oh so you think he could get through the last few months and look good ..he lost his mother but immediately he's into the role of king ..not to say that in the weeks leading up to the coronation h3 was doing duties and rehearsals ...hopefully he'll go on til the age his mother did ...
Tosh09, South West,"The King has had weeks of planning for the Coronation and endless rehearsals, meeting and entertaining heads of State, also continuing his many other duties, I think most people would look weary let alone a person of 74. He has also continued after the Coronation to carry out his duties"
Bethanywine, Cambridge,Where is she? Mission accomplished?
Maggie, Adelaide,Six years is generous.
JuleR, Worcester,"What a thoroughly unkind and unnecessary critique of the Coronation. I thought that Charles looked solemn and emotional, and if he was tired - maybe the enormity of the occasion kept him awake the night before. Im sure the fact that he had only become King due to the death of his beloved mother was also on his mind, understandably so. Leave him alone. "
madison86, new york,I actually disagree. He is the most famous king in the whole world. It's very difficult to give that up. I wouldn't :)
Madmax1001, WeWillHaveNoTroubleHere,Not a once in a lifetime event then. Looking forward to another 100 million of taxpayers hard earned being gifted to them for a family get together.
Corrigenda, St Albans,Do stop getting confused between estimates of attributable expense and real cost.
The funny man, Belfast,6 years is way too long.
Judistar, Countess,Trouble is I dont think William wants the job so he will stick at being kjng for as long as he can.
Stevo, Chester,Another expert on the Royal Family.
Britchick, Rennes,"He looked emotional and solemn,as the occasion demanded. Hes full of enthusiasm and vigor. This article is nonsense."
Willyoumarryme, Edinburgh,King Charles had a very different childhood to Queen Elizabeth.  The future queen had her mother by her all the time and enjoyed a delightful and safe childhood.  King Charles barely saw his mother; he was sent to live 500 miles away from his family and he was bullied horribly there.  Those things impact you for life.
WhatInTheWorld2020, Surrey,I often wonder how different he would be if he had been allowed to go to Eton. He must hold a lot of resentment.
Haglet, Cheltenham,@Bethanywine - do explain re: playing him lime a violin.
Glo38, West Midlands ,"Everyone ages differently, some 40 year olds are not as fit and active as some 70year olds,it was an emotional and solemn coronation for King Charles and he must have been thinking about the late Queen."
MJB20, Staffordshire ,Leave him alone 
Wake up UK, UK,"He is the King of the country and it's people, once British people fought and died for who should be our king   or as in two world wars for us to even have a king. Their job, role and purpose is incredibly important in diplomatic situations and bringing business ie work and wealth to the nation. On certain major national issues our Prime Minister will consult most weeks with our monarch explaining their intentions to the nation ie the monarch acts as a safeguard and represents us the people. I expect you are the 'feely, feely, feely' type and don't like nasty words being said to you - well this is a job that requires an extremely high level of  scrutiny in all aspects of Charle's life and like his mother requires a very tough 'backbone' !!"
johns-girl, Bristol,"I think France is richer than Britain now. They don't have a king, you don't need a royal family to bring in wealth. And that was a horrible ad hominem attack to a three word statement. By the way, in this context it's ""its"" not ""it's""."
Nancy62, Torbay,"I think he will carry on. He knows what it was like to effectively lose his mother to the monarchy, and he won't do that to his grandchildren. I agree he looks weary. The last 6 months have been a steep learning curve for him, and the unpleasantness with the Sussexes must be bewildering and deeply upsetting for him."
SydneyHarbourBridge, Sydney,"In youthful enthusiasm QE11 pledged her life of service.  Big mistake.  Now Charles III and his wife are in the unenviable position of working unfairly hard when they should be in retirement.  If he lost Camilla I fear he would disintegrate.  His coronation demeanour looked humble, and Camilla looked overwhelmed.  Abdication after a couple of years in favour of his delightful son would be sensible and understandable."
helenireland, kilkenny,I agree. I think Charles will give it a few years before handing over to William. That would also allow William's children to get a little bit more grown-up before their Mum and Dad become King and Queen.
Irish Spirit, Sydney,I thoroughly agree. My first impression of Charles at the Coronation and through it portrayed him as being very humble..
Slf84-and countig, London,"I think William will be a great help to Charles and shoulder some of burden, but I think Charles will continue as long as possible to give William time with his family and time to mature. Charles has much experience and his manner with people makes him popular! "
Drummer girl me, Stoke newington,William needs to get rid of that Diana clone before hes king
CommonSense6992, Cambridge,"What an awful, unkind thing to say."
pendragon25, Christchurch,"He's still grieving the loss of his mother and it was a hectic weekend, but he looked full of life on Sunday night."
Ron, Leeds,Possibly he has seen the future when the Monarchy falls into line with the European ones.
BeauWisk, Barnsley,"The King looked serious, as is required at such a momentous occasion. He has had to cope with the loss of his mother and taking on the role of monarch along with the terrible way that Harry and his wife are behaving. "
Rupell, Oxford,He always looks tired and irritated. The Queen never did
Kayer1941, Gods Country,"WOKE ISSUES DO MATTER to the Briti public. They are top of the List. WOKE control  the civil service and other Government  Departments,  they are behind  the boat people being allowed in, the Global Economic Forum Reset,  the energy crisis,  the cost of living, zero climate change/global warming, Overseas Aid and all the other Rediculous ideas that the Government follows!"
Getoffmycloud, Rathole,He had to wait too long this moment plus the world has moved on re all this mumbo jumbo tradition.
Getridofidiots, Somewhere,"They are not going to retire early, theyve just got started, Charles understands the role. Dont compare them to yourself jenni, retirement isnt an option for them"
Pumori73, Perth,"@Getrid ...NEITHER IS IT an option FOR MILLIONS, retirees and pensioners who have had to return to WORK - REAL WORK, REAL HOURS...."
Eleanor_Rigby, Liverpool,Completely disagree. This was a huge day in the King's life - of course he looked anxious and worn. He is committed to his role for the rest of his life.
nbr, yarm,After we have wasted 100 million on this farce he had better have an unelected tenure of longer than that.
Debsy1957, Durham,"I don't think he looked weary. Emotional and pensive, maybe, given the ceremony and weight of responsibility that lay ahead of him. Undoubtedly, William's role will increase as the King gets older but he has pledged a life of duty. I just don't see him giving up after six years. "
mollymo36, Manchester,"Please dont hand it to Waitey and Rose's fella, I cant stand any of them, but those two are the worse, sly dogs. "
Tony, Wrexham,So the tax payer will have to fork out again in a few years time?  That old money tree just keeps on growing....
Yves1234, Lancashire ,"It was the biggest day of his life, watched by millions. I think I would look exhausted too, he probably didn't sleep much due to the pressure of the day. "
Mijoed, London,"We wish him good health and a long life but, compared to Queen Elizabeth at 74, he is certainly showing his years."
salad cream, HORSHAM,It's a shame that Anne didn't confront the demonstrators herself - now that could have been SERIOUSLY entertaining. I think she's brilliant.
ANASTASIA, Adelaide,"He would scale back his duties, Delegate to other members of the family he would never abdicate. They don't do that , for goodness sake we know that."
Lippy Stick, London,"I support the system of Constitutional Monarchy in the UK, not because it's perfect, but because the alternative would not seem to offer any real advantages and some distinct disadvantages. However, I am concerned that Charles is not as liked as his mother nor his son and that the approval rating of the Monarchy will go down the longer his is King. I doubt he would ever abdicate but I sincerely hope that he will sense that would probably be a wise and popular move."
MysteryMike, Salisbury,"People who say the coronation was a ""once in a lifetime event"" obviously aren't aware how old he is and that we'll likely be doing this all again in 10-20 years."
Irish Spirit, Sydney,It's a once in a lifetime event for me at my age...
IndigenousBritish, Near you,"Agreed, he may want the title but he has no interest in the role.  He's a shadow of his mother, "
Manuka100, Leeds,It is his destiny. Why would he abdicate? He looked solemn because he recognised the importance of his Coronation and his pledge to serve. Leave him alone.
NinaZG, London,"They obvuously didn't sleep well the night before because of the nerves, it's understandable. I think they both looked marvelous."
Janet, Oxford,Anyone having to go through the ordeal of the coronation would be pretty tired at the end of it.
forestina, Bournemouth,Please can the royal stories end now.
Pumori73, Perth,@forestina - why ? The Daily Coburg AND THE experts WILL BE OUT OF jobs and bored stiff ......
West midland, West Midlands,For twenty years we speculation the Queen would abdicate and hand over to Charles that never happened either
Anthi, Allerton,"To be fair I thought Camilla looked quite frail these past couple of weeks. She has missed quite a few engagements. Charles will be heartbroken if anything happened to her, could he continue his role alone? I really don't think so."
Stella Estella , Out there somewhere,"Much as I enjoyed the day I said all day he looked like a tired, bewildered old man because in truth that's what he is at 74 no getting away from it. 5 years would be good then onto William."
nippysweetie, Tir Asleen,"No he won't. He looks that way because he's gutted about the Harry situation, not because he's ""tired""."
pangiec, Norwich,No. The carriage arrived 6 minutes early at the Abbey. The Cambridges were not late!
worlddweller12, London,He blamed them regardless
Pumori73, Perth,"@panglec -  SO, Chuck mumbling and irate while waiting for the Diva & Billy was talking to himself...there were no plants around! He was clearly heard to say "" never on time""......"
John Thomas, Newport,I give him less than that before he's run the Monarchy into the ground
moongirl, Yorkshire,"I agree he looks weary but I don't think he'll ever abdicate. If anything happened to Camilla I think he would disintegrate so not sure what would happen then. The Queen was a very strong woman, as was her mother. Princess Anne has the same quality. I think Queen Elizabeth was extraordinary as was her reign and dedication - I don't think our monarchy will be the same again tbh."
cjma, London,Agree
Daysview, South Hampshire,Very emotional  it not even a year since dear mother passed
Lance Jones, Neath,Suggesting the King will abdicate shows how little they know about our new King.
Englishcitizen, Derventio,Unfortunately he is too woke for most people.
oops up side my head, Elementary,"I think it's a shame the queen didn't abdicate so she was there to watch Charles become king.. she was the only thing missing from the coronation..
I hope he abdicates when the time is right so he can watch William become king."
Bastion Fort, London, He looked pretty lively to me before and after the event. I think you'll find he was just being solemn.
Irish Spirit, Sydney,And humble....
Meneer, nowhere,"To be honest, I don't think he can handle the pressure, because he is too frail, and too old to start this new job. Before becoming the king, he always had his mother's backup, now he must do it by himself, and he is a very short-tempered person, nothing like his mother."
NeeNee07, Yorkshire,"I don't think he will ever abdicate, but we will see William and Catherine doing more and more."
Mr Carlsen, Oslo,I give him six months.
Mrs R, Sheffield,"They are a couple in their 70s and are allowed to look tired. I hope his duties can be spaced out so they can have what we call an occasional "" nothing day"".  Doubt he will abdicate, unless some unexpected health problem arises."
PITT RIVERS, BOTTOM DRAWER,"He has just taken an Oath to serve all his days. That is what he has pledged, done and wanted. To do or suggest otherwise demeans him and the Crown."
Declaro Nullus, London,"Not the first time Fred has knelt before God and taken an Oath. How Gladys, secreted in the congregation that day, 21st July, 1981 in St Paul's Cathedral must have been chuckling. Shame on them both."
Kate, York,Great...then we have to pay for this pantomime all over again.
romft, wells,I think he will go within two years.
Full of life, Derby,"All the plans, discussions, decisions have been at the forefront of his mind for a long time, I'm not surprised it's all taken its toll but .... I think it's very unfair to comment on his looking worn out. Wouldn't any of us be like that under similar circumstances? Give the man some breathing space ...."
The Countess, London,"Rumour has it, he will remain on the throne for 10 years, health permitting and then hand over to William. I for one, think there is a tremendous sense of pride in seeing your heir crowned. I wish her late Majesty had at some stage stepped down and been there to see her son take up the mantle."
indie5018, Sunderland,It's only a matter of time when the nation will get rd of the Royal Family as we cannot afford them because the tax payer picks up the bill on everything.  Before you all jump on the Band Wagon that they bring in millions they don't pay any tax or in his case no inheritance tax from his late mums estate.  This man is worth 26 Billion so why did the tax payer foot the bill for his coronation?
man_bowler, Nottingham,Not long now before the next coronation.
sciencenerdthesecond, london,"Her calculation... new gov in 2024. Tories try to scorched Earth new gov, which they hope is thrown out in 2029. Tory gov then decides to have a bit of a do with a new King and persuades Chuck to go back to chatting to trees. "
Registry, Cambridge,"The King will not ""hand over"" the crown. That is not done in the UK. Edward VIII was forced to abdicate, Charles III will not be doing that. "
Sapientia Ianua, Brisbane,"Nonsense! Of course they look weary, have you been living up a peak in the Himalayas and thus unaware of the year or so they've had? Harry and Meghan, the death of Prince Philip, Harry and Meghan, the death of the Queen, Harry and Meghan, the preparations for the Coronation, Harry and Meghan and the actual Coronation .Charles has a heritage and a destiny to fulfil, plus he intends to steer the 21st Century Monarch to a safe harbour. Give him a break for God's sake!"
Paolo from Italy, Near Venice,"Yes, hand the power to a President, rather."
BeauWisk, Barnsley,"Never. Who wants a president when we have the monarchy. You only have to look at Biden, Trump to realise we dont want that. "
katie, Birmingham,"President Biden, Trump, Macron, Johnson, Truss? No thanks. "
Shonie, Cheshire,A lot of damage can be done in six years. 
Lolli-Poppy, a small town in,"I love Jenni's tribute to Anne, The Princess Royal. She really inherited the best of both parents.....Nevertheles, I wish KCIII and QC strength and good health."
maggot, Brighton,Jenni's tribute to Anne is not anything different to what most of us think of Anne.  Jenni definitely needs to retire as she has nothing of interest to say anymore.  She may be feeling tired and achy at her age but she has carried too much timber for most of her life.  Both Charles and Camilla have maintained a healthy and fit lifestyle for the whole of their lives so it is supposition to think that they suffer like Jenni.
Auntie Royal, Oxford,"He looked miserable, tired and wishing he wasn't there."
Generally right, Lincolnshire,We can but hope.
spinningaround36, London,Still grieving!
Whittington, Portsmouth,It was a very emotional day anyone young or old would feel the stress. The King has waited a long time for this and I'm sure wanted everything to be perfect.  William and Kate were not late the King was early.  A few days off and he will be fine.
JohnPaulGeorgeRingo, Strawberry Fields,"I don't think he will make it much past his mid 80's, so the opportunity to take early retirement will probably not happen! He doesn't appear to be anywhere near as fit and healthy as either his mother or grandmother."
Hiker136, Hucknall Nottingham,He'd be handing a chalice poisoned with wokery to a son already infected.
lucy.oxonian, oxford,HE WOULD NEVER abdicate.
Hambe Kahle, Cape Town,I don't think he looked weary at all. Emotional maybe. He lost his mother to gain becoming king. He was going through what the queen went through many years ago. Perhaps it was a poignant and meaningful ceremony for him.
Sincere Brit, Marbella,He must have been strong and brave at some stage your only to look at all those medals 
Selegne, Aberdeen,Rubbish
Skylark26, Ashford,"You have a point, but the Wueen did it and they do have an army of staff taking care of every little detail, organising all the transport, clothing required, food etc etcits not like they are hopping on and off buses.  But good luck to them."
katriona1, edinburgh,Really - there are far too many people giving their two penneth these days  He will rung a schedule as he sees fit as they Queen did as she became older.
newsuser, doesitmatter,No chance
Reet and Col, Liverpool,"He looked overwhelmed by the day, he looked absolutely fine by the time of the concert. It was Camilla who looked frail compared to when I've seen her previously."
Damien at Home, Monserrat,"You are absolutely wrong, he wants to give William a chance to raise his children for as long as possible and I know this because I have spoken with staff of the King. Maybe do some research. "
eski_adam, London,He won't abdicate but the Prince and Princess of Wales will increasingly take on bigger role and eventually William will be deputising for him. 
Grym Sdijk, Amsterdam,So the recent once in a lifetime Coronation will turn out to be a twice in a lifetime experience or even a thrice in a lifetime experience.
de661e, Chichester,That would depend on how old you are
Grym Sdijk, Amsterdam,How perspicacious of you.
Had Enough 55, The solar system,"No he wont he will carry on stoically until or if he reaches his 90s and then he will do the same as his mother did and then William will help out more. Williams children will then be old enough to take more responsibility. I do think that Edwards children we will start seeing more of as they get older, Im not too sure about Beatrice and Eugenie. "
Grym Sdijk, Amsterdam,They will all have proper jobs by then.
Red Emerald, England,Hand back the crown to the people. No place for an unelected head of state in modern society.
dvata69, kent,Part time king who hasnt got it right so far
Sweeper, Chislehurst,Garbage.
taiwan, Kaohsiung,probably less if he was smart
Pond Girl, Scotland,Let's hope so
Ladyofletters, Helsinki,He looked 20 years older than he really is. Very sad.
von56, derbys,He is old he is bound to look exhausted all the world's eyes upon him constant pressure to follow in the queen's footsteps I think I would look tired ! and I'm not 73
Urbanfox, Nottingham,"It's a monarchy, it's a job for life."
EasyTiger01, London,"If you know your history, youll know that our monarchs generally dont abdicate and the only recent example is Edward VIII. Only three other monarchs have abdicated: Richard II, Mary Queen of Scots, James VII of Scotland (who was also James II of England). Its what sets our monarchy apart from the rest of the worlds monarchies - and why its the most respected as our monarchs treat the position as an honour and an opportunity for public service. And Charles will want William and Kate to have as much of a normal family life as they can, so I fully expect him to go through to death."
Grym Sdijk, Amsterdam,The forgot Charles 1 who abdicated with extreme prejudice.
johns-girl, Bristol,I think King Constantin II of Scotland abdicated way back in the 940s. He became a monk
leedsa64, Leeds,"Really, he has such a pampered and privileged lifestyle what can he be weary of"
Trad Tory, Edinburgh,"The King and Queen were up past midnight, rehearsing again in the Abbey, after returning from hosting world leaders. I would posit that it is unlikely they would be deprived of their sleep on a regular basis."
Wishilivedelsewhere, Utopia,How can Jenny make a comment about the cost of living crisis although she has been affected by it?
Pyramid-ant, London,"It was exhausting watching the coronation, King Charles actually had to be there. It was a long day. Anyone would get tired. Like the Queen, he is committed to serve the nation as king until he dies.  "
mignon, paignton,More like 10yrs i think.
speaknotruth, Botswana,Months not years.
LongmeadMan, Epsom,Hopefully.
anro75, uk,He is 74yo and had a massively tiring weekend! 3 days! What exactly would you expect?
Johnstonw, London,Maybe we could abolish the monarchy and have a elected head of state. This is like a bad comedy
ladymarmalade, Faversham,Maybe you could look into the figures & realise how much more than the Monarchy that would cost.
Johnstonw, London,Maybe you could mind your own business. My post was not  asking for someone to chime in.
J J00, oxford,By then we will elect a committee to replace this nonsense
Callmemadam, Cannock,I can't help thinking the crowns looks faintly ridiculous.
JonnieDubai777, Munich,Even to live 6 years more doesnt look promising
DiscreetCivilisation, Birmingham,He looks fine.
SCRNSHOT, Somewhere,"He looked exhausted at his coronation and event the night before or not, he should have got some rest ahead of time. Even the official photos do him no favours."
MissyBelle, Durham,I thinks he'll wait until William and his children are ready to take the reins before he steps down.
Dmac53, Johnson City,"It was a very serious and religious ceremony. I think Camilla was a little nervous. Plus, I heard she hurt her back before the coronation and was in a lot of pain. Both of them in public appearances are very animated and seem very happy."
Yvonne Todd, Southend,"Maybe, as another step in changing the Royal family, there could be a sort of joint/job share arrangement later on, so he can share the burden and William can be eased in, but still have a bit more time for his family?"
Vernonina, Somewhere splendid,"I agree, he looks worn out before hes even started. I do not think he is physically up to the job and being tetchy is not very regal."
FISH706, Lincolnshire,"I think he may pass it for no other reason  than at this time we need a younger King, not that Charles is out of touch but that younger generations have so little regard for the elderly never mind an elderly King"
Nellie14, Outernowear,Ive been saying it all along when people said oh its a once in a lifetime event that youll see and I disagree definitely see William be crowned. Charles looks shattered and like he doesnt wanna really do it. I feel hes done it cause hes waited so long and wanted his crowning moment.
TheSagePhilosopher, Andromeda,I agree. I highly doubt he will be King for   very long. I give it 5-10 years tops before he pulls a Edward and leaves it to William. 
dinkie1993, Solihull,"In the last few years his father has died and last year his beloved mother.   Add to that the nonsense and hurt he has received from Harry plus the long ceremonial day and evening of his Coronation and just ask yourself, wouldn't you look worn out?"
Mira21, Berlin,The Queen should have resigned at 85 to ensure a successful reign for King Charles and to protect the monarchy. King Charles seems energised and happier since he came King.
NorthernProfessional, Preston,Hard life....don't think so.....extraordinary wealth and privilege at every turn....the pay off is they have to turn up everywhere and travel the world shaking hands until they die...that's the deal for an accident of birth
Lola250589, Nowhere,"Hes waited 74 years for this no way he is giving it to william, also dog features wouldnt allow it."
Med7773, London,I'd give it 5 years
The Fermi Paradox, The Universe,"In terms of staying the course, there's still all to play for. On one hand he's looking weary and worn out yet on the other he's waited to be king for all his life he may hold on to the crown until the bitter end or until he can go no further."
Alamo Vyann, Suffragette City,"I don't think the King would abdicate unless there was a really compelling reason he could not perform his duties.  King Charles apparently wants his children and grandchildren to enjoy family life as long as possible.  (An opportunity denied him and his parents by George VI's untimely death).  If  Charles became incapacitated, there is precedent for William to become Prince Regent. "
ArrogantCat, Manchester,And then we have to pay for this whole farce all over again!
Kikidoo, Dubai,"I'm sure I read in this paper that he planned to start handing things over in 10 years time. Personally hope it's sooner, though"
Happy memories, Somewhere,Ridiculous comment.  Charles was clearly very moved by the ceremony.
Kiev1910, nowhere,Go away luv there's a good Doris
Unknown, The Milky Way,The late Queen managed well into her 90's
Full of life, Derby,Not many hit their 90s in as good a shape as the Queen was.
johns-girl, Bristol,Not a Royalist but I always had respect for the Queen. She comported herself with dignity. I can't really say the same for Charles. Getting angry about a pen
Dellboy, Bourne,He's a year younger than me. I'm giving him 5 years.
Bizzibody, Manchester,"Please get your facts right, as I've repeatedly requested. The Prince and Princess of Wales were NOT late arriving at the Abbey. It was the King who arrived early, as expertly explained by the commentator on whichever channel I was watching. The procession had been paced out at so many steps per minute in rehearsal, but when it came to the actual one, they walked slightly faster, so in fact the King got there too EARLY. I agree that he looked tired, but he did through the whole ceremony. At one point I honestly thought he was going to fall asleep."
unicornangel, Warwickshire,I definitely don't think many 70 year olds could do that 
Platothesecond, Cambridge,"Agree with the author,   ' We should be congratulating the police on ensuring that the biggest ceremony seen in Britain for 70 years passed without mishap''.  At last our police allowed to remove rubbish from the streets !"
Gingercat2007, London,Agree.
HappeningRightNow, NearHere,"It's hardly a difficult job when literally everything is done for them. They just have to show up,smile and shake hands. I do like the royal family but there's no denying that it's a life with huge privileges."
johns-girl, Bristol,Won't he have to have a meeting with the prime minister every week?
Teresa1066, Cape Town,"I watched the whole thing. He did not look even remotely ""spaced out"" at any point. "
Suzie, Durban,"Jenni Miurray is just stating good old common sense. One has to move at a different pace as one ages because one's body is not the same. Nothing wrong with that, except public expectation. King Charles will simply have to hand over the more physically demanding roles to Prince William & Princess Catherine, and still keep the crown as he is supposed to, and still predominate at affairs of State."
Antelope_67, London,"Seeing all the pomp and glitter of his coronation, it would've been amazing if the late Queen actually abdicated and seen it all herself.   I hope this is something the King took to heart and would actually want to witness for himself.   "
Jane ROBERTS, Oxford,"Abdication has never been an option, not after Edward VIII."
Naomi, Ireland,"I agree with Jenni, I thought they both looked exhausted. Surely they could take a  ""honeymoon"" and chill out in Sandringham or Balmoral for a couple of weeks and recharge the batteries? That schedule of theirs would be hectic for a young person, let alone a pair of septuagenarians. Take a break, your majesties, you've earned it."
Jinine Carla, Brisbane,I've always said he would be transitional king 7 years tops. He won't want the monarchy to suffer and William wait like he did. Catherine and William are the most popular royals so it would be a major positive move. Of course H needs removing from line of succession first . 
RUStupid, NoneOfUrBiz,"He looked tired and weary that day. Hes not young. He will hopefully pace himself. And in my own very humble opinion, whats wrong with that?"
STRAWBERRY WASP, Dyslexic Daily Mail reader,"When watching the coronation on the TV me and my partner said he would do ten years maximum.  We both said the same, they both looked exhausted as you say. And this is just the start."
jamesyallenby, London,The King will never abdicate. If he becomes physically or mentally unable to carry on Prince William would become Prince Regent but not King until his father passes on.
SueC12, Bishop Auckland,It was a long day and it was a huge thing for him. He takes the responsibility very seriously. It's not a game to him. Also it would have brought back memories of his mother. You could see that when he took the oath.
here2findsomethinh, Anywhere ,"He's the most pampered person in the UK, why does he look so aged and weary."
Royal Malarkey, Somewhere,He was impatient tired and grey looking all day. Not a smile from him all day. he couldn't even trim and tidy his hair and trim all the hair over the back of his neck. He looked like a try hard playing an important role. 
maggot, Brighton,"No he wasn't, he was solemn, reflective and emotional.  I bet his mother was in his mind a great deal of the time.  He is still in the early days of grieving and it showed.  "
No_ennui4me, unfortunate Californian,I disagree. I didn't see them looking weary... I think Charles has waited & prepared for so long  that he is game on.
Lesley Lesley, Toronto,"He's always had that look. His mother should have done the right thing and stepped down when she was 65 or 70 and let him take over. The way it is now, he's got only about 15 years. She should have stepped down."
Jimmy, Liverpool,Absolutely love Princess Ann. William to me is the true King. His daughter is the model of our late Queen.  
Jemima1, Dundee,"Hope so, William and Catherine will make fantastic King and Queen. "
Farmgal4, Somewhere,"I totally agree; he does look spent.  My mother says that nothing destroys a parent like losing a child and for all intents and purposes, Charles has lost a child.  And it shows."
pammy, Greenville-SC,"What rubbish! Its not as if hes been sitting around and suddenly has these duties. Check is calendar of engagementshes always made countless appearances, as well as taking on several more as the Queen cut back her schedule. Hes had to deal with the draining daily missives from Harry as well. Not easy to be King as your family breaks down."
Sorcha7, Boston,Thank you for articulating what many think. Sadly Charles looks old tired and not regal. We need vigor of William and Kate not two pensioners
Queen of Funk, Here and There,"A lifetime of living in the lap of luxury, being bowed and curtsied to, amazing palaces and trips, to them only do the main job for 6 years? Sign me up for that job"
A1historian, Edinburgh,"The line-up on the palace balcony just served to underline how elderly the so-called ""working royals"" all are. Most are in their 70s and 80s, while Prince Edward will be 60 next year. That really leaves the Prince and Princess of Wales very exposed, as there are no other , younger members of the royal family lined up to support them.  Prince Harry's ship has well and truly sailed.  King Charles may not like it, but before long he will surely need to start calling on Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, both of whom carry out charity work independently, and possibly Lady Louise Windsor to step into the breach.  Either that or  we will have to get used to seeing very little of the royals in future years - not a good omen for the King, for , as his mother famously said, she had to be ""seen to be believed"", and so will he."
Rene, New Jersey,His heart is broken over Harry.  I'm sure he was looking forward to sharing this moment with both his sons.  Shame...
capt. willard, siem reap,But America elects geriatrics 
David_from_San_Diego, San_Diego_California_USA,"I don't think he will ever give it up.  Nor do I think he will ever stop involving himself in divisive political and cultural issues.  It's very sad, because William and Kate would breathe new life into the Monarchy.  By the time William gets his chance, more Commonwealth countries will be republics, with their own heads of state.  It's so sad to see this happening."
NicolaWilliams, London,"13, not 6. 13 years."
Drew Doughty, Los Angeles,England is the only set of Royals who uses their power to downgrade their choice of spouse
Anavrick, Bikini Top,Six years is too much.
Lifebeginsnow, Essington,"I think most of the senior royals looked very strained on coronation day, including William, Catherine and Sophie. I think they'd have a lot of rehearsals and other engagements in the run up to the coronation and the stress of worrying about whether it would all go to plan, showed on most of them.
"
maggot, Brighton,"Yes, it should have been a joyous occasion but it was filled with worry over what grenades may be thrown by the Montecito pair.  Luckily none, but they still attempted to fill the media with themselves to divert attention. "
Tynebridge55, Garden grove,He can designate as much work as he wants but as long as he's alive he's the king.
Angus MacFarlane, Aberdeen,"He became heir to the throne at the age of 4, he said. He has been the longest serving and oldest Prince Of Wales in history. It is his duty to be King. What sort of example would he be setting, if he were to abdicate?"
Duchess of Ekhaya, Pasture ESTATES,Six years for Harried to mend fences with his brother....or he will pay another 28 hour visit to London at coronation of his brother.  This time he will stand by the palace gates and then leave to take Archie to play school or something 
Reader42, killed by Death,He could barely hold the staffs. He looked irritated and worn
mariebattis, Syracuse USA,"The Crown is for life, and he's waited a long time for it.  No way he will give it up."
TJ, San Antonio,"""As William performed his duties to perfection and his wife looked every inch a Queen-in-waiting, I couldn't help wondering how long it will be before the next Coronation. Might Charles, at the age of 74 and Camilla, 76 in July, decide in the not-too-distant future to pass the sword, the orb and the crown to his son?""  I think not.  I think there is such a thing, just a notion, mind you, called a schedule of events for every day that includes public appearances, paperwork, greeting foreign visitors, et al.  I think be a stickler for being on time is not a sign of anything but being a sticker for being on time.  Unless there is mental or physical decline, the same provisions as for the late HMTQ are in place and it may be time to rethink the number of public appearances all year for the RF anyway.  If you think this has not already been discussed inside the Monarchy, you live in your own little world."
MsKitty888, BANKSTOWN,"Charles doesn't seem anywhere near as healthy as his parents were. I was actually having this conversation over the weekend. Her Majesty and Prince Philip were so robust, full of energy and life almost to the very end of their lives. Charles just doesn't seem to have that energy at all."
TXBrit12, Austin,Kings and Queens don't abdicate - unless it's extreme circumstances - so no chance he'll go.  He will see his reign out until the end.  Of course I doubt he'll live as long as The late Queen did - but who knows
BeesKnees2021, Wherever,"I think KC3 realizes that he doesn't have the life-long stamina that HMQ had, and that William is poised and ready to take over when he is no longer willing or able. I say when he's 80, he'll want to go back to his simpler life in Cornwall."
Isla__, Chicago,"Queen Elizabeth was a rare breed. Very few people reach her age in good health with a steady walk and hardy disposition. Still, Charles DOES look frail. A lifetime of trying to stay trim hasn't done him any favors."
Katieanne75, Albuquerque,"Several friends and myself hit 70 last year.  All of us seem to feel slower and more tired.  I don't know how King Charles and Queen Camilla can keep up the pace they do and will have to do during their seventies.  I wish them well, but I hope they know when to retire and enjoy the years they have left. Youth is coming up behind them who can do what needs to be done."
Brh, Bluffton,"The monarchy should be abolished, the Royals assets returned to the Treasury. They can each receive a pension equal to the average government pension. Perhaps each be given a modest home and a Toyota."
Northern Australia, Townsville,"What a waste of a life,if you can call it that."
llois, Every City,He does look weary but I can't see him stepping down. I'll never know anyway. Quite sure I will have perished!!
Irish Spirit, Sydney,Me too. I won't be around....
Hello its me, Stars Hollow,He'll never give it up. He waited too long. And William has a young family to raise.
Vancouver, Dallas,He's looked weary since he was 12.
Member 877635, Somewhere,Phillip retired in his mid-90s.
Alonzo Quijana, Miami Beach,Poor Charles.  Poor Camilla.  I hope they are getting enough rest. Such demanding schedules! And at such a late stage in life. 
MileHigh, Denver,"Charles has always looked 10 years older than his real age, thus I'll take the under."
all smoking mirrors, Dublin,"He's 20 years and more younger than the Queen   was when she passed. on her feet till the very end , he has plenty of servants , to cook and put his meals on the table , doesn't even have to make his own bed , do his washing or wash his floors , secretaries to do all the paperwork , how can he be exhausted ?"
FlyingWithoutWings, Bolton ,"He's had a lot to contend with in this past few years, the deaths of both his parents, Harry and Meghans shenanigans. Mental fatigue can be just as debilitating as physical fatigue, sometimes more so."
Pru, Stafford,I doubt it.
ArkhAngel, Boulder,HRM could have stepped aside 20 years ago.
TiredOfExtremists, Donny,"His mother and father were very active as 'our first couple' into their 90s.

So what balderdash "
Una Key, Nottingham,"I don't think he will or more likely can. It's all down to the Duchy of Cornwall. If William is King and Prince George is too young to take the Duchy over from William, what then?"
NeedyGonzales, North of the Border,He waited over 30 years to be king. Minutes count when you don't have much time left?
Real Talking human, LA,"His official king photo portrait with crown looked not a bit ferrety and self conscious, opposed to confident control like a king should be"
LLRM, Somewhere,They both looked completely worn out. The Queen was much better at putting on her happy face and getting on with it no matter the circumstances. They didn't even look like they tried.
Lizebirde, Dixon,"Nonsense they are doing fine, no need to put them out pasture, the younger royals can do the harder work."
mizpris2u, Albuquerque,"He does look pretty tired but if he wants to keep going, he has certainly earned the right. "
Ziggy Stardust., The Shire,He will never voluntarily hand over the reigns after waiting 74 years to become king. He will be on the throne until he breathes his last breath.
Prudence, My City,I believe he will stay until the end; he would not break tradition.
Luxes, England,"Totally agree about Charles future, just had this conversation at work today. He does look weary and old and this massive costly ceremony for a few years of being King seems obscene.  He's tired and rightly so. Too old to be crowned king however I do suspect it's been to allow William sone life with his young kids first."
I love hockey, Columbus,Completely agree. I thought he looked pale and frail. The struggle he had with the pen a month ago or so showed me an elderly man losing some wit.
LoveMarmite, Almost Brighton,"Leave him alone, he's doing a good job so far. Of course he looks tired, he's hardly stopped since the Queen died and this coronation must have been hanging over him with all the things that could possibly have gone wrong. I doubt he's been getting much proper sleep! I'm sure now it's out of the way he will have a chance to recharge his batteries. Some people just have to put the boot in don't they. "
Shirley214, Titusville,"I do not think his visual weariness is down to his age and well being.  I think he has been very strongly affected by his mother's death, more than any can imagine.  I believe this deep sadness is taking a toll ."
simbatipps, No Where Land,"I couldn't do it and I'm many years younger. The stress and hassle, life not your own"
Gaby, london,I agree that our police force did a phenomenal job. lets stop with these republican sentiment. just look at the US and you would change your mind
KyIce, Lexington ,He lost his Mother. I was weary too when I lost mine. 
Whatever33 , Twinkies,I give him less than 5 years! He does not look well!
SuperCT, Los Angeles London,"That would break a precedent. Other than abdication, every king or queen has remained in place until their death. Personally I think he should have passed it straight on to William, but since that would also break a precedent (no heir has ever refused the position and handed it straight to the next generation) doing that could be seen as a sign of weakening the monarchy, so I understand why he hasn't, aside from the fact he's waited his whole life for this. Either way, they need to rethink it: he could easily live as long as his mother or father, meaning William would be in his late 60s by the time he inherits the crown. Considering we're centuries away from early deaths at the age of 40 or so, it becomes absurd. Unless an untimely death befalls one of them we're looking at generations of kings or queens who will be in their 60s or 70s when they take the crown. If they want to keep the institution going, that's not the way to do it."
mydaywillcome, WindsorCastle,Charles should start the process of ending the monarchy. 
Alphaplus, London,Quite a few people I know have retired before state pension age 65-70 as with the pressure they thought frankly they wouldn't get through to retirement.  King Charles in his 70s should pace himself as we'd like him around happy healthy and active for some considerable time to come.
Rough Shod, The Gallops,"Don't forget that His Majesty has just been through a traumatic eight months, with barely a moment to draw breath.

Within a year his equilibrium will be restored, and we will have the monarch the King has promised to be. "
BlondiLocks, Mbro,"Agree, the police have nothing to apologise for. "
Actual Proof, Zumbi Ilha Da Governador,"He is not weary, he is old.
It happens to all of us."
sunnys, Sheffield,"I think everyone seems to be making too much of the grumpiness is the carriage, to me it made him more relatable, just like my dad and grandad grumbling about time keeping while the rest of us are running around losing things, it made me smile as both dad and grandad are no longer with us"
headline skimmer, Dogger Bank,This will not happen. He'll do his duty and his son will do his. 
Jp666xx, Wirral,"They never had over, they just limp on until they die. For all their wealth, what a horrible life they have. I can't imagine getting my first job in my 70s."
TheGenuineSeer, Paisley,Hopefully Charles will live long enough to experience the abolition of monarchy.
WhoaBessie, Jensen Beach Florida,He was early.  William was on time
Devereau, Ludlow,I also think it would be a good idea.  Once William is King Charles can be his support rather than the other way round.  Charles has worked  so hard for so many years he deserves to retire in dignity.  God Save the King.
Disillusioned, Somewhere wet and windy,The Coronation was a joyous celebration of natural progression but it was also a constant reminder of the loss.  Perhaps his 'sadness' was remembering the loss because it was a great loss to so many others as well 
Dennis, Neston,At 75 he is rather old to be king and he should do the same as the Queen of the Netherlands and abdicate in favour of his son William in two years time.
Davey McDonald UK, London,75 going on 105.
CarrieRose, Norwich,I thought less than that.
London4ever, London,"Whether fit or not, Charles will never give up the crown."
filirid, aberdare,"He has lost his mother and his son is doing his utmost to destroy the institution he heads up, he is heartbroken "
Spgoisern, Chessytown,"Many of us have lost a parent or parents, many of us have troubles within our family. The difference is that whilst we struggle to cope with it all, we also have to go out to work, pay the bills, bring up our families, do thd housework, the shopping etc. The King doesn't know what real life is, he's been pampered all his life."
johns-girl, Bristol,"Well said Spgoisern. I lost my parents within a year of each other a decade ago. I was only in my mid 30s, my parents were in their late 60s - too young to die, really. I grieved for them. I still do. But I had a young daughter to bring up and a mortgage to pay. So I saved my grief for late at night and for the rest of the time just got on with stuff. Because that's what most people do."
Well-travelled Lady., Kingsbridge,"Totally agree with you, Jenni.  I thought, as soon as we saw him enter the Abbey, how white & exhausted he looked."
Townsey, Northumbria,"During the coronation I thought he looked tired and weary. The stress of such an event after the recent death of her majesty the Queen, must weigh heavily on his mind. But I for one, have no doubt he will carry on with his role, until time calls a halt, and William succeeds him. God save the king."
Number 1968, UK,I noticed at their Coronation how the both struggled and on occasions had to be assisted to their feet. Years of good living has prematurely aged them
Irish Spirit, Sydney,It's called ageing and it happens to everyone...
dudhchsha, England,"The late Queen, The Queen Mother, and Prince Philip all carried out duties into their 90s and beyond...why couldn't Charles, if he has his health? "
Sue Smith 1, Coventry,I hope its sooner..
SupremeJediMaster, Newport,He needs a holiday!
guy.burgess, West Meon,Long live our Queen of Hearts....Diana.
Mouth of the Mersey, Liverpool,He won't
JR1012, Gloucestershire ,Hopefully 20 years for his reign would be great.
Paulo Gabbini, LONDON,He's not that old only 74 he could be King for 20urs or more.
Glanford Spong, Salford,"150 million for 6 years then do it all again. Come on taxpayers, work harder, pay more tax."
er9, Sunderland,"I hope Charles continues as King for at least ten to twelve years or so in order for George , Charlotte and Louis to get through their teens before William and Catherine succeed to the throne."
unusual suspects, Bumole Bay,"He's always looked a bit weary, that's his resting face, so what."
JQX, USA,"King Edward VII was king less than 10 years, following his 60+ years as Prince of Wales through his mother Victoria's long reign. It's the natural order of things in a hereditary system. King Charles surely knows his recent family history and that his reign will be short enough without giving up the throne."
johns-girl, Bristol,I was thinking the exact same thing.
Henry Harvey Henry, London,He has done a marvelous job so far but if he chooses to give it all up soon I believe I speak for everyone when I say enjoy a well earned retirement your majesty.  
Estrella01, Preston,Marvellous job!!!! Doing exactly what?
FeathrrsMcGraw, KAIMUKI Honolulu Hawaii,I agree. It's  hard to start at such an age and expect to take care of everybody.  I think William is quite capable.  Kate is strong and wise .
Bullitin, Banffshire ,Yep... 10 years at most....
jemma1962, Norwich,I for one do not think he will do that long. I think 3 maximum.
HG86, london,Good Kings and Queens do not abdicate.
HG86, london,It was a very tiring year and event! Give him a break!
Bambi, Andover,I think his energy is incredible for his age. Don't forget they had weeks of decisions and rehearsals. He genuinely works really hard and for long hours. I couldn't and wouldn't want their lifestyle and schedule and I'm half his age
Gentry244, Lexington,We can only hope and pray William and Catherine are on the throne soon rather later.
dandydazzel, Leeds,"I would feel tired having  to go through the day  without making a mistake, hoping everything works out well.



"
ErinJordan, Tucson,That long?
Mcampstx, Dallas,"So did Queen Elizabeth, but she never gave up."
Logcabin, Somewhere in the Woods,He took an oath to serve for life.
Lissette, Chicago,And i thought I was being generous saying that he would last 20years. 
Andy1, Norfolk,"What do these people not understand about being a monarch. They just cannot give up the job, it's a life long position. Only to be removed by a government!"
LongmeadMan, Epsom,"Ever heard of ""Abdication""?"
johns-girl, Bristol,They can choose to abdicate if they so desire.
christineispristine, Watford,He has no reason to abdicate and pass on the Crown ..he's in that job until he dies ..like his mother and grandfather father before him. 
Targel, Somewhere,GASP!!
Russiamom, Texaa,I read that he wants to pass it down to William in 10 years.
Zlisters, Kings Lynn,Six year's? Really Jenni? I was thinking five max. But then again I'm not a royal expert.....
simonh44, london,If the Royal Family was a blue chip business and brand (which it is in many ways) strategic sense would be to make William CEO and Charles step into a Chairman role. William and Kate are marketing gold and the world would have reacted much better to their coronation.
benny, Nottingham,I could not decide what was off about him. He has been on big stages before and had a great support network but he seemed detached and flat unable to summon the energy necessary to star. I don't think it was all nerves nor the solemnity of the occasion that got to him but something was affecting him.
Indignant, Sheffield,"The constitution dictates that he is monarch for life. Abdication would create a constitutional crisis, so it wont happen."
GirlOnThePlane, Northampton,Actually think he would like to walk around with that crown on every day.
Pagewizards, Dodge,When you have lived your entire adult life having every whim indulged its hardly surprising there are a mired of things that will irritate. This was demonstrated when the pen wouldnt work.
skyhigh , Adirondack ,To judge him on a day that followed a week of rehearsals and hosting international dignitaries is extremely unfair.
Bobbyripandroar, Miami,"He has longevity on his side.  Both parents were in 90's, grandmother even older."
Catgirl62, Middlewich,How insulting! Service is at the centre
Jane, Fort Worth,That's not how it works.
Bearham, Coulsdon,"Would be for the best, but he has waited all his life to be king. A sad situation all round."
jamesyallenby, London,"It would not be for the best.  The Monarchy is not a job that can be taken on and left at will. The King is an anointed, invested King and he is committed for his life.  If he gets too ill to carry on - although our late Queen did - William will become Prince Regent but not King until his father passes on."
Thing Explainer, Sceptred Isle,"He has invented the job of Prince of Wales.  No other Prince of Wales did what he has done:  they all led lives of leisure sitting around waiting.  He has defined the role, a very hard-working support role, where he has actively CARED and LISTENED and represented the UNHEARD and actively sought to make situations better, most notably those of young people and the environment.  It's kind of nuts that we're now told 'the Young People' don't care about him, think he's irrelevant and are turning away from the monarchy.  It says more about their ignorance, than his character. He has actually being doing 'monarch' diplomatic work all his life as well:  he has stood there for QEII, met all the heads of state, politicians, diplomats.  He did the exact same job but gets no credit for it."
cindyloo, Austin,"He would not do this unless Camilla dies, then maybe."
MitchE, Southend,"He could not do this because he took an oath in Westminster Abbey as well as on the day of his ascension to serve till his death. To do otherwise would be a disgrace and the only time that William will ""take over"" behind the scenes only is if the King becomes incapacitated in some way.......as the family stepped up to lesson the load when Queen Elizabeth became too frail to walk much"
G Adaline H, Muswell Hill,We can live in hope. I cannot see His Majesty lasting long if Camilla should go first. I realise thats an awful thing to say but my grandparents are just a few years older than C & C. I couldnt imagine them working in their 70s :-(
Royalslover, Portland,Yet Queen Elizabeth did it......
Suzie, Durban,Queen Elizabeth learnt the ropes and was able to get into her stride from s very young age and put her stamp on everything. Circumstance made it happen that way. Nothing unusual really. Just different.
LovelyLorelei, Norwich,"Yes, but she was only in her twenties when the role became hers and she had to do the commonwealth tour that a new monarch is obliged to carry out."
Angry_Parent_USA, Across the USA,Frail.
YoCo7, The Hague,"Not at all, I am sure the rehearsals and the actual coronation day activities were very tiring, no matter what age one is. "
John 1975, Northampton,It would be very clever and honourable thing to do for our Kind to hand over the reign sooner than later.
Arlo1, Reading,If he has gone through this expensive pantomime knowing that he intends to stand down well.
Aine 24, Kildare,"No imagine the uproar about the cost - reprinting everything to replace King Charles, arranging amd paying for yanother coronation ?   If he didn't want the job he should have abdicated before he became king and allowed William to take the role"
DemocracyRules, TheLandOfMilkAndHoney,Princess Anne was second in line to the throne until Andrew came along. Ten years. Displaced further by Edward. It's interesting and remarkable that she has had a successful equestrian career and combined it with being a working Royal. A very hard working Royal at that!  If anyone had just cause to be naffed off at her treatment it would be Princess Anne. Not only was she born The Spare but she was further twice displaced by her younger brothers. Because she was a female!  Yet she has borne all her injustices with good grace and has not turned on her family. The look of love and pride at watching her brother be crowned was only matched by the same look from Edward. Charles is very lucky to have their support. As for Harold and Andrew...what can I say???
Mycatmurphy, Onanotherplanet,"Who on earth is Harold?  There is no one in RF named that.  Oh wait ....  do you mean Harry, his given name is Henry, not Harold.  LOL"
Boldin4, Newmarket,Bravo!
Lady Ascot, Ascot,Queen Elizabeth managed it pretty well so why can't these two?
TudorRose, Middleham,Yes. They're youngsters in comparison. 
oldsoldier7492, The North,Edward VII was in the same situation - he was 60 when he came to the throne..  He lasted just 9 years.
Longhornrose, Houston,He will serve until his death.  That's the job.
Louisa, London,"@CC - a lot of the monarchies which pass on their crown while they are alive are not anointed monarchs who make vows before God to serve the people until his death. Most monarchies have a simple swearing in where they promise to serve and leave it open-ended. There's nothing progressive in serving a nation until death - it's one of the few noble things Charles can do for the monarchy, but given his cavalier attitude to vows in the past (to Diana, to the public that he'd never marry Camilla, that she'd never be queen, that she never be crowned...) there is the outside chance exhaustion might overcome his vanity and he will break his coronation vows too."
jayemcee, LONDON,"Charles has waited all his life for this, and certainly won't give it up unless his health declines so much that he has to.  Yes, he is elderly, yes, he is tired - who wouldn't be? But his sense of duty won't let him step back unless he's actually forced to."
gd2929, Chicago Burbs,Hard disagree.  He's been waiting for this his entire life.  He'll die with that crown on.
Vivelo, here,we can't afford another few billion for all the changes
peopleinglasshouses, Manchester,Agree he doesnt want to work as hard or be as dedicated as the Queen though just the glory and perks
null, 18 hours ago,He won't pass it on. He's waited to long for it. Not sure his blood pressure will hold up though.
Thing Explainer, Sceptred Isle,"Quite right Kate:  in this age of people pretending to care about others' mental health, it is appalling to see how much the Left thinks it's OK to bully Charles, who has clearly suffered anxiety his whole life. The BBC chose not to focus in on it or comment on it, but the banner on the screen in the coronation read ""All will be well, and all manner of things will be well"" which is a famous quote from English saint, Justin of Norwich (who, confusingly, was a woman - fascinating story though if you look it up, which shows what an intellectual and faithful man the King is)."
johns-girl, Bristol,Julian of Norwich.
Scott, Wgtn,Are you daft or what? To even think that Charles would abdicate is an absolute nonsense on your part.
no one cares19834, Béal Feirste,Fingers crossed
Dixie-Belle, Georgia,After waiting his entire life? Not a chance. He will be there until his last breath.
sweetportia, Basingstoke,As it should be !
Fishphilip, Chichester,Um. You can't say bad stuff about the Royals. The Met will be round to sort you out!!!!
Upamountain, Geneva,Not unless you misgender one of them
Youknowiamright3, London,He looks fine
Owt or Nowt, Yorkshire Satellite ,I've been looking tired since my 30s and to be fair it was a long day for him.
RUStupid, NoneOfUrBiz,Exactly!!
Jon Yorkshire, York,Nonsense the late Queen carried on all her adult life
Kicogo, District of Columbia,a lot of speculation in this article. 
Indeed100, Here,Maybe sooner? They both look old and tired. 
RTnVA33, Humanity,Yes so agree!
John H, Stourbridge,He looked ashen and weary at his Coronation.
Katey222, Over the Rainbow,"Of course, he was exhausted and stressed but he will have some time to recover and carry on. "
G Adaline H, Muswell Hill,I thought it was all the makeup TBH. Concealer for the redness and foundation to smooth out his usually ruddy complexion
Skeptical nana, Greenville,I would like to be alive when William ascends the throne. I'm 77. What are my odds?
Dinky Dolittle, Dorset Coast,I reckon Charles has 20 years so if you keep pace with him hopefully you will!
MargaretMarkham, Birmingham,"Me too, I am the same age as you."
zkiwi, Los Angeles,For years Charles has looked closer to expiring than his dad Prince Philip did before he passed. Who knows.
Dame Cabbage, Atlanta,You don't just hand over the reigns. That's not how it works. King Charles is weary because he's had a tough life: his first marriage and now his son Harry. He's a gentle and sensitive man. He deserves our support.
Just a nobody, Essex,Absolutely agree with you
johns-girl, Bristol,"Or reins, even."
ViceGrip, Home,Wow becareful lady the peasants won't like you saying that about their king and queen.
Notfor, Somewhere,Yawn
Dane mom, Denton,I'm sure the problems with Harry have worn on him.  
Czelustine Prophecy, Buffalo,Lol no way
Grandma Bee, Portland,He always seemed the same age as his mother
Scottgirl, San Francisco,Lolso true!
InvincibleTruth, Gold Coast,They Enjoyed Each Others Company and He'll Follow Her Advice.
Gilly, Allendale,"Her Majesty the Queen was an extraordinary person, attending to her duties full-time until very shortly before she passed away. King Charles III is NOT his mother and will likely retire from full-time duties at a much younger age."
Earth Mother, north wales,I can hope
A. Pedant, Bristol,Rubbish! Why should he not carry on just as his mother did? I doubt if any of us expected the late Queen to carry on the way she did.
RayDavid, Jacksonville,"First real job for Charles, he has been living off of his Mom for 74 years....."
Kimmeridge, Cambridge,"Jeez, Charles has worked incredibly hard, just not had the thirst for media attention."
Morgana4961, Southampton,Very ignorant comment.
Windy Ridge, Virginia,Camilla will make sure he stays King until his funeral.
Blues2u, Nunyabiz,I concur ! !!
UptownGirl2022, Olympia,I guess you his haven't seen Joe Biden lately. Some people keep trucking long past the weary look. We have a President with a brain on autopilot!
Miss Lincs, Lincoln,"Still better than what you could have had and may well be getting soon, unfortunately. "
Ghostrider, Panama City,Perhaps....but if Charles does hand over the crown thankfully it wont go to Harry!
Ghostrider, Panama City,"Sweetportia, unless Charles skipped her of course it would most likely go to Camilla but waiting on the sidelines is William!  Who is ignorant now?"
MKLee1953, Columbus Ohio,"Ghostrider, Camilla can never be a reigning monarch. The next in the line of succession is William."
James Burns, Spring Hill,"he is so weary due to a lifetime of being babied and coddled, poor thing"
all smoking mirrors, Dublin,Exactly
DIAMO, London,Sad to say but the glamour and mystery and thrill of monarchy disappeared with the late Queen  Charles is a dreadful replacement. The late Queen was an extraordinary person and a true global giant  for many generations of us . There will never be anyone like her again . But weren't we lucky to have lived in her time . And how we will always miss  that Queens Speech on Xmas day . Such a cherished tradition and memory . Hard to think she's no longer here .
Louisa, Dorset,She really wasn't as great as all that. She made plenty of missteps: the respect she engendered was the sort borne of longevity. No more and no less.
mclarek, NY,True but she wasn't going to live forever. KC has been learning the role for decades and will do a fine job. Tad unfair that he has to start the job  at 70s but do we have to start blaming HMTQ? I believe he had been preparing in earnest for past 15 years taking on roles behind the scenes. I wish him health !
Ray Charleston, Brooklyn,His swollen fingers are a bad sign. 
Narfb, Toronto,You'd look weary too if you had gone thru everything he has over the past year. Give the King a bloody chance. Geez.
Pete16, London,Well said!
Al53, Cardiff,True.
JimmyRustler, Pyongyang,"Well, its obvious that Charles wont live to his mothers age. But I dont think hed ever abdicate."
Sprung, Lalaland,Why?
Frustratedtaxdonator, Hartlepool,Well said
MARYS, UK,This makes my blood boil statements like this.      Unbelievable.      Have a lovely day everyone
Nancy Moon, Bootle,Personal opinion and free speech  has gone out of the window if  it doesn't praise king charles III to the rafters. 
John No New Normal, Edinburgh,"So freedom of association is to be denied within families too
"
Zandramas, South West,"I don't understand what she was expecting to see. Was it a surprise that the senior royals were all white? Was she not aware of their existence beforehand? I mean, Harry married a mixed race woman who could have provided a bit of diversity for her, but she didn't want the job, so what can you do?  "
Missing Aussie, Newcastle Melbourne,Spot on!
BlueGreyCat, Surrey,This is getting out of hand... Freedom of speech
C Green, Swansea,Cancel her.
Raffles25, Glasgow,Cancel these two.
Bogbog, Norwich,"Did she also think the small anti-monarchist group was ""terribly white""?"
Chokka, Shangri La,Good point!
congo2, Heswall,We live in terrible times !!

DaisyDaisy40, Cardiff,Absolutely. 
Señor Citizen, Scroggingham,"No,one had the guts to say 'Sorry ,what do you mean by that?' On air and at the time."
YouAintReady4Me, Notting Hill,Well done Catherine Mayer....
RickinTokyo, Tokyo,There is a bit of me that has gone from the rich diversity of the Abbey to the terribly female only presenters on this TV show. Im very struck by that.
Ggooch333, Whitstable,Really.?? Pathetic ..this is scandalous and we should be in uproar...
wiselady, Warrington,I'm a white English person GET ME OUTTA HERE!!!
Kent Graham, Kent,"Let's face it. The way the BBC works is that if she didn't defend the actress, she would be cancelled!"
madastheycome, lincoln,"Well if the Markle woman had not caused so much trouble, ther could have been a non white face on the balcony"
alderton10, Sydney,"Well, of course, if one was a Republic, one could avoid the line-up being so hideously white."
Wickedworld, St Helens,"Only one there with any sense was Myleene Klass, her face said it all. "
CMTHOUGHTS, Barnet,Don't use her again!
dan bolton, bolton,Only 4.165 complaints ?  Have the rest of them been brushed under the carpet?
Futurelover58, portsmouth,I'm not a fan of myleen but her face was a picture as the other lady spoke!!
Louisa, Sheffield,Adjoa can say something a bit more intelligent and tell me where she bought her shoes.
Marciac, Tamla Motown Land,This entire subject is getting out of hand and one-sided.
Stansded, SPALDING,"Scraping the bottom of the barrel by inviting these pundits in the first place, so we shouldn't be surprised with their crass, ignorant comments! "
Robbie Jimbo, Cambridge,"Yes, a fool nods along with another fool.  They're two fools together."
Felicity Swale, Bristol,The original comment was a completely unnecessary observation. Part of the endless commentary across the coronation weekend. Often less is more.
Edward Teach 1680, All at Sea,Soon certain people will want you to apologise for being white in this country.
Furioso, Manchester,Not a fan of Myleene but shed definitely a rose between two thorns on that couch!
Dom Ely, Cambridge,"Actors and journalists all belong to the same lefty fraternity, so those comments are no surprise to them, and only a shock to the majority of rational viewers who continue not to be represented on these broadcasts."
alderton10, Sydney,Charlie's family profited hugely from its slave trading. Everyone knows that. Still no apology.
Ex Tory 1972, Outside the EU,"He should apologise for something he took no part in, and couldn't change if he wanted to. Yeh that makes sense. "
Tommy737, Cambridge,How can she defend the undefendable? Millions heard her say it.
Sleepy comments, Edinburgh,This is what is known covering my backside just in case 
I hate lefties, Reading,Why does a white family have to defend itself about being white. Her supporters have completely misread the room. The Royal Family do not have to be diverse just to please the likes of a two bit actress.
Hillzmac, Earth,"A terribly white family? What that hell is that? STOP the world, I want to get off!!"
tripaway, London,Who is she? Where did they find her?
tony63, wiltshire,Coward
Hakkon, Wonderland UK,"Virtue signalling, pure and simple. Im not surprised that Ofcom have had so many complaints about this utter nonsense. The whole race thing has now gone into overdrive and the wheels are falling off ,like many other narratives that have been unleashed on us in recent years, and reasonable people of all races are sick and tired of it all now. "
MrsHenriettaPeacock, Middle England,Hope they both get cancelled!!!
chubbles, Xenia,So you are in favour of Cancel Culture!
TC_home, Worthing,"If my family, going back generations, were to stand on a balcony .. we too would be terribly white. The huge majority of the UK population is terribly white. Calling this out as something wrong is plain wrong, its not a crime or anything to be ashamed of. There's no law where-by families have to be culturally diverse."
jtir774, burnley,Exactly!!!!
Irenem, Staffordshire,"Well said, my family is the same."
LoobyLulu, Stratosphere,So 4165 people are wrong and she is right. Don't think so.

Forksake, Manchester,"Probably won't work again, TV companies are not going to risk the controversy"
SaoPaulo, London,Well said Catherine. More qualified to speak on royal matters than all on here
Ulster1690, Belfast,"Really, is she more qualified to decide whats a racist comment or what isnt. ? "
Emz73, Manchester,Why do you need to be qualified to know that was a racist comment?!!
Nigel, Hove,"As soon as you see the the word activist, you know exactly what youre going to hear."
Frank, UK,"The BBC should have had a quality, informed, and educated individual like Tom Bower on the programme instead of an actress."
Poolside Bather, Sandy town,How was she on the show anyway? Ridiculous thing to say and if it was the other way around there would be uproar! Hope she gets cancelled idiot.
Box56, Bolton,Well said.
grumpie, Preston,Exactly.  
CathD, The Big Smoke,And we're off again!! 
EggnogatCrimbo, Crazy town,"Your fear and turning a Blind eye to the obvious is  whats wrong with the world, you just dont want to be cancelled or called the term you fear most."
Broflakemocker, Notinmynamegrandad,Goodness me look at the comments on social media and the trashy channels all full of blatant race baiting she's not far wrong.
Loopylou307, High Wycombe Unfortunately,Charles needs to review this relationship!
Dewsnap1949, London,Never mind nodding - - - both women should have been challenged at the time  in the studio!!
Davies65, London,If the shoe been on the other foot people would have been fired immediately
Basilbrush007, Kent,Exactly
ArchR, Wilts,Oh dear! Those were some of the worst and most divisive comments I've ever had to hear on television. Totally appalling and probably way beyond escape with a forced apology. Career ending normally in today's climate created by like-minded individuals such as this.
steve in kent, Kent,Cancel them both
Jane, London,"Incredibly offensive to comment negatively on the skin colour of a family. Are you suggesting that the Royal Family should marry for optics? That people of colour should be used as tools to improve the image of the Royal Family? Have a  conversation about privilege by all means, but this isn't the way to do it."
Sandyhills, Sandy,"Well thousand do think she has to apologise, so you are in the very very very small majority who think she has nothing to apologise for. She has and needs too."
MICK53, Newcastle,It was a stupid thing to say 
Truth-will-out4711, Manchester,"That's because they are white family.
You can't just change your colour to appease someone."
Lyndaharve, London,Another frightened to lose her job sort!!
Mr A, East Yorks,"That's her opinion, my opinion still counts and I think she was wrong."

Too-thy, East Angles,Whaaat!! oh dear lady how wrong you are!.
White Cross, Ripon North Yorkshire ,Another one who career will come to a end
DickHertz7, Wokeshire,It's her opinion. Each to their own. What's the problem?
Phoenix2k3, Norwich,But if it was quoted the other way round that would be a different matter wouldn't it? 
Lipservice, Tentcity,"The problem is if the same thing was said on a broadcast of a Coronation, e.g., in Lesotho or Swaziland there would be Internatonal outrage. So nothing to do with her opinion, everything to do with a fake narrative said only to cause division."
Mortarion, Sheffield,If it would be wrong to say it tne other way round then it's wrong saying it like she did. I'm sick of seeing such hypocritical double standards.
Time2p, Borderline,Maybe she should ask meagain why she felt compelled to make her appalling comment
faolan, Bedford,""" Former Labour"", says it all."
mtwallet, Middlesex,Desperate women trying to stay relevant 
Laughingatyou, London,"White balcony as it is a white family, what the hell does she expect."
Dani, Across the Pond,Their coverage was awful but the only choice I had to watch here. All they did was make snarky commentary. It was clear they were anti-monarchy.
bettyboo., Belfast,She needs to be dismissed. 
Lady_In_Red, HASTINGS ,Two desperately woke idiots who know flipping well they are out of order!!!!   
John Thomas, Newport,The problems with this Country are all sat in that studio and it is them and their supporters who need to be cancelled along with the Broadcasters who give them a platform to spout their venom 
DWI196, Bangkok,Great comment John!  So true!!
Say it sim, Lanark,"Only 4000 complaints , How many people actually watched the programme , Millions 4000 complaints is nothing to worth writing about."
ItchyBitz, The Thames,"As a British descended white person raining mixed race children, once again I am being made to feel ashamed of the colour of my skin and apologise for something I have no control over. I really dislike being female, mid-forties and White."
Hedgehogman, Birmingham,"What? I mean what? I honestly do not understand what reality this other woman is living in. Unless it's pure virtue signalling, in which case she clearly sees the problem but allows her wokeness to counter it. Absolutely nuts."
MICK53, Newcastle,You're afraid to be cancelled. Your own fault for saying it
Bev, Going down hill,It's indefensible
Freddy2910, Southampton ,A lack of diversity exists in probably 90% of British families. So what? Doesn't mean to say we all have to heave a sigh of relief when a relative falls for someone from a different background to tick the woke box. 
Pipsma, Valencia,Indefensible
Mr S from Derby, Derby,That's what happens when TV insist on being inclusive when what they should of done just invited the best commentators no matter what colour they are! Then again I bet this is exactly what ITV wanted
Pipsma, Valencia,I  used to have a nodding dog.

Vic11, Worcs,And how would you suggest they become more diverse?? They are a family for goodness sake!
Greggors, London,The Royal family heretige is white. You can't change that. It's like saying there isn't enough white people in the Nelson Mandela family.
Arvel, City,ITV has been on a journey to become more woke than the BBC. It  has now arrived at its destination.
MICK53, Newcastle,There was no need to say that at all
Ramitpeckerhead, Liversedge,It's a good job very few people care what she thinks innit?
Will Nottell, Toytown,I like the look of Myleene as that woman spouted her nonsense.

Tillys, Staffordshire,Neither do the royal family have anything to apologise for.
Snetta Vintage59er, Black Country,Racists come in all colours not just white. 
conwycrown, Cardiff,Very true. One of each on that programme proves your point. 
lyingwiththefishes, Atlantis,Well she's a cowardly woke disgrace 
Cut to the Chase, Sussex,"Utter claptrap, I said it before they are a white family, what did she expect, it was an ill informed crass statement from an actress perhaps trying to raise her profile, who knows. "
Iseult, North Coast NI,"My opinion is that freedom of speech is important, but that anything you say won't necessarily meet with agreement therefore others are entitled to criticise your words. I find it rather bizarre that anyone would bring skin colour into the balcony appearance of the royal family, I mean why would they even be thinking of skin colour at such a time? Still, it got Ms Andoh a lot of publicity which may not be unwelcome to her, maybe now time to stop with the headlines, DM. "

lurchygirl, Derby,While wokeness reigns supreme we will carry on getting these hurtful and idiotic remarks.
hampstead1955, London,What is the author thinking defending the indefensible...no one is more tolerant of other races than Charles.
Evangelina7, MANCHESTER,First thing I was taught on my history degree - you remain impartial.....  this writer clearly has never taken that on board.  You express no opinion. 
YorkshireLassYork, York - England,I cant believe what Ive just read!!!!! Its as bad as the BBC portrayal of Anne Boleyn 
yep2345, Nottinghamshire,The notion that being white and groups of white families congregating being a bad thing does not fix racism. It creates a new kind.
Lizzie, London,Very foolish to make any comment 
Proud Monarchist, Feck LFC,She is just another nodding dog afraid of being cancelled
Flummoxed1, Coventry,She rattled on about slavery and I had to turn over. She's totally buying into the lefty narrative and trying to stay relevant.

michellew, letchworth,Think its due ti Meghan not being there
chestersfriend, ForeverEngland,Sack her aswell! Double standards 
Dave, Manchester,Absolutely pathetic.  Get over yourself.
Not-telling, Wales,"So the backlash is 'white fragility'? We could say a similar thing about her comment. But, of course, it only goes one way. It's strange that the wokeys don't mention the lack of diversity in governments, including the top level of the EU as well as African and Asian countries. But no, it's just the UK. As someone who grew up in a multicultural area (Cardiff), I have never known such divisiveness in this country."
Michael, Somewhere,The comment was facetious and entirely unnecessary. I am sure if it had been the other way around a police investigation would have ensued but it seems that free speech only works one way.
nojoyantiques, SOUTHAMPTON,Totally stupid comment & equally stupid to nod in agreement. So typical of todays crazy woke agenda where common sense is replaced by lunacy.

Getting Fedup, Now,Another one happy to have our history and culture 'Blackwashed' 
Montag, England,"Factually she was correct. But there are a 101 facts that can not be talked about, because they are not considered PC. The woke can say what they like but anything that goes against their narrative is deemed unsayable / unprintable. The DM are a bunch of cowards."
Simon Cole, Norfolk,Everybody on this bandwagon now. Fry and Brandreth a bit late this time
G-hush123, London,"Slight tangent here. But Myleen and Helen Flanagan are currently appearing in 'I'm a celebrity' BUT Myleen was on this Coronation show, and Helen was pictured at some awards ceremony two days ago. I'm so confused.

The rest of the RF have no legal role or powers, are just hangers on, using their unearned titles to avoid a proper job. There is no need for this 'Royal Family' with hundreds of leeches. "
dickobrien, Renwick,"The whole family are just ribbon cutters, muttering 'and what do you do' to people they couldn't care less about. But it excuses then from having to work. After all who would employ 'Prince' Edward? Without his title this twit would be resitting his car park attendant's course. "
Bee Tolerant, Leeds,"I agree with this article.  Unfortunately, Charles decided a long time ago that Beatrice and Eugenie would not be working royals.  That, imo was a mistake.  Whether Beatrice would be willing to do so now that she has her career, while also being a wife and mother who knows.  While Eugenie lives, it has been reported in Portugal, which is where her husband works.  Meanwhile, Edward's children are still in education and,  of course,  should be allowed to study.  Anne's  children have now made their own lives and have successful careers.  Charles, it appears, has what he wished for. However, imo it is not good for the future of the monachy."
dickobrien, Renwick,"A UGOV poll shows that 79% of the population did not attend a Coronation celebration. This was not reflected in the hysterical descriptions of a rapturous, deferential population in the DM, TV,  and all of the press."

Realviews, England,Prince George will be about 50 to 59 years old by time he's king. So I sure he will have his own family. He might do the same as Queen Victoria and have 9 children.

Sense seeker, Marlborough,"Whilst the Falklands war was on a police motorcyclist complained of the number of supposedly minor royals he had never heard of had to be escorted at high speed for no apparent reason!  Far, far too many hangers on, just look at all those that complained they should have been invited to the coronation!"
blake_jake, newport,And ???????
therose58, Dorset,"slim down the patronages, use the Edinburghs and Anne's children "
David4018, Portsmouth,how on earth can you be burnt out opening a few aldi supermarkets a year.
dickobrien, Renwick,What workload? There is no pressing need for minor royals to give their lives a meaning by being patrons etc. or having silly military titles as Princess Anne does.  Let them get proper jobs and learn what real life is like for ordinary people. 
BeverleyMacker, The Big One ,William can bring in who he wants when he gets the top job. I wouldn't be surprised if The York girls and the Edinburgh children are invited into the fold. Sophie and Edward by then will be the elder statesmen to assist too. Along with the 3 Wales children there's ample options. 
mog, down south,But why should the York girls or the Edward and Sophie's children want to be involved.  So many come out with this statement about hangers on but what these don't don't realise is that those on the periphery do some amazing work supporting charities etc.  Why should the younger generation put up with snide hanger on remarks.  Sophie said once that her children would have to work i.e. have careers.  Why should the two younger Wales children want to be treated badly by the press and accused of taking money and being hangers on when they could be earning a living outside of the RF.  this country can't have it both ways.
Openourworld, London,"Ridiculous that the younger generation and all Williams cousins were not included - The late Queen relied on her cousins - most undertook many duties and patronages. William and Catherine cannot do everything and be everywhere, and their children are very young. There are so many organisations that need a next generation figurehead who is active."
mog, down south,"What i have thought all along when Charles has said he wants a slimmed down monarchy.  As you say the Queen had her cousins to call on and support her.  I remember the Duke of Gloucester landing by helicopter on a recreation ground near me.  He was supporting a charity and opening a building.  Very mundane but he did it and with his presence brought publicity to this charity.  This will all disappear.  The Windsor children are isolated they have no royal cousins.  the two younger children are entitled to say, I don't want this life, I want a career."
Openourworld, London,"100% agree - Princess Alexandra and the Duke of Kent look like they wont be able to do much! Freddie & Sophie Windsor are a real credit to their parents, Ella, Beatrice & Eugenie, the Tindalls and Edwards children could keep the Royal patronages going until the three children have families of their own. There are literally thousands of organisations who really benefit and will soon have no royal figurehead."
Churston chancer, Torbay,"This is the real reason Harry left for the US becuse he could see himself and Megan being dumped on.....
Along with Anne,Charles and Camilla only have a few years of being capable of doing a significant workload.
In the short term the load will fall on the Edinburghs and William /Kate until their kids are old enough in 10 years ?
Harry saw that he and Megan would be used until such time as they were no longer needed and then tossed aside, so decided he would determine his future and not William. This is at the heart of the fall out between brothers.

"
SunFunBeach, Nashville,"Oh please. Those whiners left because they were/are jealous. Period. They cannot take being second place, not as in the spotlight. Especially Meghan, cannot stand being upstaged by the wonderful Princess of Wales."
xglm37, Sydney,"Harry's wife boasted she would earn a billion dollars a year when she left the royal family.  Your logic is faulty. By your logic, Princess Anne should have been ""pushed out"" of the royal family 35 years ago. Yet Princess Anne is a very popular hard working senior royal."
Nolier, no,Actually you need only one King or Queen.
BLONDIE43, London,Do er need them ?
yyyyyyy, Sydeny,No. Only Charles is needed so long as all that is asked for is the constitutional role and none of the other ceremonies and visits etc. Queen Victoria managed to disappear from the public for 40 years and was a much beloved Queen. 
JBB, Notts,"The by now famous ""Could"" again."
Anon, UK,Hopefully 
anteater, London,I count 7 in that photo who are in their 70s or 80s. Including the King & Queen. In a matter of only a very few years this is going to be a problem. Even the late Queen when in her nineties went to Sandringham & Balmoral for extended periods. She was fortunate to have enough back up but Charles will not have that looking at the photo again.

Nancy-R, TX,"I don't see how the RF can support and highlight their many patronages. Charles won't have the help he needs in 5-10 years. Princess Alexandra and the Duke of Kent are too frail to make any but the most important appearances. By the time William is King, he'll be forturnate to have Edward and Sophie, although I expect Anne will be going strong until she's in her 90s! There needs to be planning done on work William's cousins can do, even if only part-time."

Kristina Fang, New York City,"The Duchess of Cornwall (refuse to call her Princess of Wales) and the Princess Consort (refuse to call her Queen) are my least fave. My faves are Prince Harry, Princess Meghan, and Princess Anne. Change the monarchy laws and make it so that the public can vote for their fave to take crown. You'd have Queen Anne which is way better than King Charles and Camzilla."

Qknowsbest, Glenbogle,When George takes over?? These people will either be dead or in wheelchairs. There will be an entirely new group of contemporaries to help George when the time comes. What a dumb article.

BrPeRsheet21, Somewhere-Out-There,How does a traitor inspire you? Make her your Queen then. I am not surprised how people in your country think. 
Jules, Seattle,"She will never be Queen.  Why would your daughter want to be a treasonous, backstabbing grifter that abandons her own family? If I were you I'd worry about my daughter's intentions for you in your old age."
NewYahwkStateofMind, The Ether,Why are you blaming the Sussexes?  Didn't Charles tell Harry there wasn't enough money to support him and Meghan (because Charles was so skint with only $20 million a year).  Were they supposed to do it for free?  For Kate and William's hand me downs?  Charles wanted a slimmed down monarchy and that's what he got.
Daisy1856, Smith Station,No.  Charles said he would not give them money if they weren't going to work!!   Huge difference!   They wanted to ditch the royals except to make money off their titles and Harry's dead mother.   Good Riddance!!!
Russian Princess, Sydney,"The author of the article points out the very young Charles and Anne in the 1953 photo. George, Charlotte and Louis were not present in Charles photo but are nevertheless the youngest family members who will grow up quickly and start assuming more official roles. "
yyyyyyy, Sydeny,"Princess Alexandra is YOUNGER than The Duke of Kent. She turned 86 last Christmas Day having been born 25th December, 1936 while the Duke was born in October 1935 - the last grandchild of George V born in his reign. He is also the last royal to have Edward VIII as his godfather. She also doesn't need the Lady Ogilvy as that is only used on the most formal of occasions."
Mblossom, london,"Beatrice and Eugenie should be apart of this line up, minus their father of course "
mog, down south,"I'm sure they feel well out of it.  In the limelight they were constantly complained about, their clothes, holidays, coming out of nighclubs, their boyfriends, their parents.  They have both married well, got a family and I imagine, don't need the agro of dealing with the press and constant criticism.  They both do some charity work but low key."

ALICE315, TORQUAY,"It's capturing history, you mug."
Colby Bates, Portland ME,James and Louise are too far down the order of succession to become working Royals. What you'll probably see is Beatrice and Eugenie helping out until the Wales children are older. Beatrice and Eugenie are next in line for the throne after Harrys family and their father.
Daisy1856, Smith Station,James and Louise are grandchildren of Queen Elizabeth II. They would be fine working royals if they wanted the job.
anteater, London,Beatrice seems a nice girl. But Eugenie's loyalty is to the Markles.
MadameMoon, Moonville,where is JamesAllenby when we most need him?
Yankee Molly, Toronto,He is probably plum exhausted after the coronation.
Maryeithnemoore, Swinford,Don't think the monanchy will survive after the late Queen 
AVCE64, Victoria,The end of the monarchy was predicted in Queen Victoria's reign yet it's still going and going strong.
Yankee Molly, Toronto,A German Prince Consort was smart and saved the Monarchy from tanking during Queen Victoria's reign. Not the same scenario this go around.
Mr_Edd_The_Head, Sydney,What a silly article.  Does the writer forget that William comes before George who is still a child.  There will be plenty of replacements as the old guard move on.
yyyyyyy, Sydeny,There are no replacements between William and George though. Charles and William have told the York princesses - no - to being working royals. Louise and James have been raised to get other jobs and support themselves so it is about 20 years before any replacements - i.e. when George is 29 and even then he will be younger than William was when he became a full-time working royal at 35.

FromVee123, london ,Prince George will have his own family plus his sister and her family and brother his family and maybe just maybe his cousins from across the pond might step up seeing as they are prince and princess now - if not - they should hand those titles back!
Lesley, New Zealand,"A lot of assumptions there - that George will have a family of his own, and that his sister and brother will be interested in being working royals.  They may have their own plans.  And I think we can rule out Archie and Lili who aren't being raised to be royal."
Pupis112, NY,"me and 4 other parents have petitioned our childrens elementary school to teach things about what princess meghan stands for. she's the greatest royal theres ever been and she's a role model for me and countless other people.what britain needs to do is change the rules and allow her to be queen, what you people would gain is unquestionable."
Calliem, Greeley,What being married twice. Handing out pot? 
Jane, Reading,Buy your children 
MyCatSays, Atlantis,George wont get to be king. The monarchy is on the wane.
chris, Sunderland,"I am a monarchist but I believe that slimming down is the way to go. As the older ones depart the younger ones will take over. The monarchy is changing for the first time in 70 years, and so it should. The ""Victorian"" order of the way things work will not work for the future and William an Kate realise this. They are the ones that are leading the change and I think that Charles realises this and paving the way. "
DailyBile, Sunny uplands,"All this guff about a slimmed down RF. it's not just about whether Andy is in or out, it's about how they slim down their demands on the public purse. And pay proper taxes like the rest of us do."

sunshine4u2c, Pittsburgh,William will hopefully be able to raise his family before becoming King. I say hopefully because he's a devoted father and husband and deserves the opportunity to fulfill this most important role. Charles had the opportunity but squandered his family time doing everything but. I hope Charles can hang in there for Williams and his grandchildren's sake.

mrs.presley, liverpool,All oldies this picture will be changed soon and there after
c_brown, Yarm,Obviously it calls for a reduction in the number of events that the Working Royal Family can attend. There is no way that William and Kate can sustain this pressure on their lives and the lives of their family. 
Yankee Molly, Toronto,Give over.  William and Kate have a plethora of staff and can hire more.
countrygirl24, winchester,They can double their workload and still only be doing half the work of their relatives. They go on several private holidays a year ( every school holiday). They have great PR.
Zaieet, Newtownabbey,I think history will see that picture in a very different way. It contained two people who are not working members of the Royal family.  So Prince Harry was deliberately kept out of the photographs out of spite. The king is giving his son and all other family members a clear Message to keep quiet about what goes on in the royal family even if they do things that would be considered unlawful to the rest of us plebs. 
MNsmartgirl, Minnesota,"The photo is of ""working members"" of the royal family.  It is NOT one of ""the Windsors"".  Vice Admiral Laurence accompanies his wife often.  "
VIVHRH, London,"The resolution to this is simple. Bring forward Beatrice and Eugenie. It's a complete no brainer than the sole princesses of their generation could add huge value, awareness and provide decades of work which the older and lessen known royals can no longer maintain."

sciencenerdthesecond, london,"Chuck is going to be around for a while yet, then William will be around for a fair few years after that. This is assuming there's no life-extension technology or medical breakthroughs in the next 30-40 years.

MamaBear2021, somewhere,I have always thought they should bring the York Princesses into the working fold. They have never put a foot wrong and could be an amazing addition

ndeg, N Yorkshire UK,So let me put you straight.  The RF did not cast Harry and Meghan aside based on jealousy.  Meghan decided she didn't like not being top dog like she expected to be and so convinced Harry to leave.
Calliem, Greeley,Princess who?
my opinion3515, Portsmouth,I don't get it. What do they do and what is their pay (out right and in kind)? Most importantly is their pay coming out of your tax dollars? If you are paying for people to simply be on display then just say so. Accident of birth should not convey any rewards by the government.
ndeg, N Yorkshire UK,They are not just 'on display' as you put it.  I suggest you don't comment on things you know nothing about.
Daisy1856, Smith Station,You need to do some research on the Royal Family.  You are obviously ignorant on the subject.
bob_001, Leeds,If you had an elected ceremonial head of state would you be expecting all their relatives to work for you as well? 
ndeg, N Yorkshire UK,No - that's the whole point. They are the Royal FAMILY.
USER-_BEEN-__-BANND, FIVE-HUNDRED-TIMES-BOO-HOO,French republicans are @ r s e - holes and the best advert for keeping the monarchy. They all think THEY are royalty.
Daisy, Jardin,Haha . Some are snooty too.
Denise Winton, nottingham,Load of grifters. 
Denise Winton, nottingham,Camilla has made piers Morgan the voice fir the royals. Against Harry. Choose your dinner guests wisely ma'am. He's causing havoc. 
The Skorpion, London,Angela Lavine and Citronella Whyatt are friends of Camillas too.
USER-_BEEN-__-BANND, FIVE-HUNDRED-TIMES-BOO-HOO,I hope you're not fat-shaming Eugenie.
Daisy1856, Smith Station,"Eugenie is not fat. She is pregnant, dummy."
Tommy Sandwiches, Polegate,Make the Yorkie girls do some work or take their titles away.
MNsmartgirl, Minnesota,"Beatrice and Eugenie get no money from the Crown.  Their titles are a birthright, unlike titles such as Duke and Duchess which were given to them. "
Denise Winton, nottingham,How is 8 people going to do the work needed for thousands of charities. He's shot himself in the foot. The Queen needs to stop entertaining piers Morgan.has she made him the voice fir the royal family. Against Harry. What is going on. 
The Skorpion, London,Angela Lavine and Citronella Whyatt are friends of Camilla.
CC, Anywhere Everywhere,"I agree, I think this is what Princess Anne was trying to convey too. However I do agree with making changes so it's more efficient etc. But the goal is to be efficient while maintaining a high standard of service."
sammy, luton,"If you're a monarchist, then this could be a very scary time for you.  The whole future rests on the Wales damily. If the Prince of Wales does what he did once before and takes the whole family on a journey and heaven forbid they have a crash and all die...whose next ... the US branch and then the disgraced uncle Priince.
If we don't want the us branch on the throne, then I think the King needs to remove them from the line of succession, because they are very close to the top."
Lee Dunn, Glasgow,"who cares, theyre all useless. Get rid"
Myndview, Church Stretton,Time for them all to go
Myndview, Church Stretton,What a silly reply. Not allowed to voice opinion that a republic would be better?

NickM, somewhere,Millard talking boll0x
HandyAndy70, Burton upon Trent,"Is it wise to encourage children to follow & ""hero worship"" someone who it has been proven to not follow their own standards that they demand of others?
Who seeks personal gain in the loss & suffering of others?
Hay, if that is the sort of role model you endorse, enjoy your pod cast with your children. They are the adults you created. "
Karriann, Middle Earth,The young children need to return to school and the privacy of their home. They have been far too exposed recently. The work for the elders is appropriate considering their rewards.
Daisy1856, Smith Station,"They were only out of school for the weekend and holiday, right?  Like all the other children in the UK?"
pondlife, farnham," An hereditary  monarch as head of state, fair enough, but why do we also need anyone other than himself/ herself  and their children involved? Let the relatives go and earn a proper living as private individuals. "
Rolos, Right Here,"Personally I'd hate Britain to become a Republic, the politicians et al would simply elevate themselves as nouveaux royalty, move into the vacant palaces and cost us even more."
EnglishBloke, Manchester,"Hasn't happened in the Republic of Ireland, why should that happen here? "
English_Pride, London,"Agreed, which makes the Wales family even more essential to the future of the Monarchy. And causes one to raise eyebrows when reading commenters proclaiming the Princess Royal at age 72 to be indispensable to a successful Carolean Reign. There is only one person or persons essential to the continuation and maintenance of the Monarchy and that is the Wales family. "
Lee1875, Birmingham,The Royal family will probably be in exile by then with the way this country is going
Pupis112, NY,"my kids wanted to watch the coronation, however i didn't tell them that princess meghan (aka the nations sweetheart) wasn't present) they kept asking me, ""where is she?"" i had to break the bad news to them that princess meghan wasn't invited and they broke down in tears, thats when my oldest son jerry started chanting ""we want meghan!"" i've never been so proud! we spent the rest of the day listening to meghans podcast. this is how meghan inspires!"

William and Catherine have young children and can not be out everyday doing the king and queen's service .    It is outrageous for Charles and Camilla to think so .

EVICHKA, Washington,Offshore to Banglore.

TheGinger23, Gloucestershire UK,I think the odious s k a  n k Brooks at the Sun wants to be a Dame or Digger is nosing round for another 'Honour'...the sycophantic outpourings from a newspaper that gleefully wrote about t a m p o n gate is quite nauseating...the D M are as bad...and as my Grandfather once said...if a clown moves in to a Palace he doesn't become a King more that the Palace becomes a circus !
TheGinger23, Gloucestershire UK,The truth will out...and as my Grandfather once said...if a clown moves in to a Palace he doesn't become a King more that the Palace becomes a circus ! The m s m have been positively fawning over the past two weeks BUT the fact is nobody apart from the stupid and duffers actually like this 'man'...and most of us would have preferred William and Kate...I think the Sun and the D M have been the most sycophantic...embarrassingly so.

The Skorpion, London,"Labrador22. Chelsy only left after being targeted by the media. Phone hacked, bugged, followed."
scarlet_ibis, London,"I don't see the problem. A slimmed down monarchy simply will need to do less. Fewer patronages, fewer ribbons to cut, fewer dignitaries to receive. Spread more thinly, royal patronage and a royal presence will become even more valued and the royals will be able to focus on what is most important -- those things which unite the country and inspire pride in our culture, history and traditions. Great wisdom is needed to choose the right things to focus on."
mariebattis, Syracuse USA,"A larger group might have been due to the Queens long reign, and more and more charities and people being added. I imagine it was quite a bit smaller when the Queen was newly crowned, and perhaps smaller yet under her father"

Idealogue, South West,DM not covering the Piers Morgan issue.
Maeve Scott, Indianapolis,What issue?
nainen, Kaupunki,"The late Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, didn't choose Charles' team. He has in that picture his team. If something happens, and William must act as a boss, he can make his own choises. I think it's wonderful that the older members of the Royal family are surrounded by love, respect, and the work they still want to do."

Sareme, London,"Sophie and Edward have two kids, George has two siblings, Zara and husband's three kids could be brought in to help, Peter Philips has two kids, etc. There will be plenty peers around in the RF to help out if needed."
Diplomacy, Derby,Sophie's and Zara's children do not have titles so that they don't have to become working royals. They will have their own private lives to lead.
PamNZ, Whangarei,Diplomacy ...The Duchess of Edinborough's children DO have titles. Although entitled to Prince/Princess they use Earl of Wessex and Lady

Commentsposter, London,"I thought it was frivolous and disrespectful of Queen Camilla to put her 2 dogs on the front of her Coronation gown. This is an historic sartorial gown and she put 2 of her own dogs on it. She could have put flowers from the realms and UK on it, or other things but her 2 dogs?"

Deweydecimal, Default,I can't see James becoming a working royal.  He always looks totally disinterested.
Randomwitterings, London,"James is fifteen for crying out loud, most fifteen year old look permanently disinterested."
Sheboy, Toronto,A lot of them are well past retirement age. Not fair that they're expected to work at such an age. Think Diana compared it to being worked like a cart horse. They're literally being worked to death. People like to think that the Royals are privileged but they are merely servants of the People.
COYL, London,"No they are not, DM you do come out with some crap!!"
Commentsposter, London,"Ive been saying this, there is plenty of work to go round. Princess Anne is phenomenal but her work load is at a killing pace. Thank god though that Harry and Meghan have gone, they were ruining the monarchy and its standards."
Robin_Hud, Destin,@Tusnelda It is shocking how much you DO NOT know. 
The Skorpion, London,How were they ruining the monarchy? Some of the monarchys standards are iffy.
Javisa, Miami,"No problem. Theres a new generation coming up. George, Charlotte and Louis will all have their own family. So dont worry"
LadyScot, London,I totally agree !
Mr Carlsen, Oslo,The plan is to end the Monarchy there will be no place for such institutions under a Marxist dictatorship which will be their one-world government. Charles is a woke globalist who will commit treason by handing our sovereignty over to WEF.

on the border, Flensburg,"The German presidency is not governing but representing the entire nation. Or should be,
Not really cheap, because each president gets an office and some staff paid, they receive until their death""Ehrensold"", a bit more than some cents.
Electing a president means bad blood,  sometimes at least.
For Germany, no monarchy, no emperors. No Prussian Hohenzollern, no Bavarian Wittelsbach, no Welf(Hanoverians).
For Britain/ the UK? Difficult to imagine your glorious country with an average very normal presidentship."
KingAgamemnon, Utopia,There will always be a second cousin twice removed somewhere!
Joliefan, Blackpool,"Being realistic, the only possible help will be from Lady Louise and The Earl of Wessex. The Kents children have their own careers, likewise the Gloucesters. Annes children are out of the frame, and thats about it. Thankfully I cant see either Beatrice or Eugenie being of much value, so it looks like poor William and Kate will be pretty done for physically and mentally by the end of their reign."
RogerJolly, London,George will be fine. By then AI will be running everything.
Edith, York,"Yeah gee what could the answer be staring them in the face....solve all their problems at once.... What the DM & other UK media have done w Harry and Meghan, aided and abetted by the Royal Family, is effectively kill it. They have jettisoned the only 2 with charisma out of jealousy. So the Royal Family haven't done their job. Their job is to protect the institution. Once you introduce culture wars to the Royal Family, once you ignore the ""family"" part - it won't work. It was unpleasant to watch and the relentless abuse the couple take from the UK media is drearily ongoing. Yet - they were the only headline in the run up to it and on the day. Where they were - what they were or weren't doing. Therein lies the answer and the problem. Kate and Sophie, who the Mail claims ""dazzle"" and ""stun"" us are 41 and 60. Neither is a world class beauty. But they have one in the family. Wise up. "
Randomwitterings, London,Ok so in your opinion neither have world class beauty. I guess that's a matter of taste. What they do have though is 'class' something that the less shallow tend to put a higher price on.
Pupis112, NY,"i personally spent the entire weekend shunning the shoddy royal farce and decided to talk to my kids about how princess meghan aka the nations sweetheart inspires hope and change. anyone notice that the royal had a swift rise in popularity when she appeared only to be hit by a new low now shes gone? she is the nations sweeheart, the peoples princess and like millions of others are willing her to be the next queen of britain. thank you."

KCCMJJ, Jersey CI,Prince George has Princess Charlotte and Prince Louise to help him
Rogan Josh, London,There's loads of them. Ask Lady Louise and Lord Severn to help out. Zara and Tindell can help out. Beatrice and Eugenie. Plus their kids in decades to come. There are enough royals for all the events and charities. They just need to share the workload around.

I'm sure if that had been a remark made to me about a child I was expecting I would remember every syllable, it seems strange the details have always been so hazy. "

L.A.Carrie, Los Angeles,"The monarchy as we know it today will barely exist under William who wants to make deeper cuts. By the time George rises to the throne, the Royal family will be like the other royals of Europe who were sidelined and are irrelevant. They will vanish into the history books."
unfree777, Newcastle,what will netflix do?
on the border, Flensburg,"The existing and surviving  monarchies in Europe are not irrelevant.
But how should an American understand history and tradition which are still important to the majority of citizens?
The soft power  and skills of Royals are still remarkable."

Violet, Peak District,"When George becomes King he'll have his sister and brother as well as his spouse and their spouses, they could all have children old enough to join the firm too. "
I have opinions too, Sunshine City,Yes and there will be cusins and their children and scads of dukes and duchessses who will be grown up by that time and he'll get all the help hie needs.
WarandPeace, Toronto,Let's get real here. The 'work' they do is really just advertising themselves at public events. It's not hard work and they could stop at any time they want - and not receive their generous funds from public taxpayers.
returntodecency, Utopia,"The Sovereign Grant is a sum of money paid to the Monarch to run the Royal Household and cover all Royal duties including those carried out on behalf of the Monarch by other RF members.  It is paid by the Treasury and is just a fraction of the money paid into the Treasury by the Monarch from the income of the Duchy of Lancaster, I think the most recent payment was about one sixth of the money which had been paid in."
Capt Sisko, Shropshire,"@WarandPeace. Yes, as the Emissary I get invites to all sorts if events. I've married couples, blessed children, prayed for the dead. I've fought the Cardassian and the Dominion and finally joined the Celestial Temple after defeating the Pah-Wraiths in the Fire Caves. Sounds crazy doesn't it - Rather like your view of the Royal Family."
vinca, Massachusetts,"Here's an oxymoron, ""working royal""."
No bodies fool, Borderland,Getting really fed up with the whole circus now. Give it a rest!
Deirdre, Dublin,"George will bring Harry, Meghan, Archie and Lili back."
L.A.Carrie, Los Angeles,Meghan will have long divorced useless Harry by then.
The Skorpion, London,Can you let me have the winning lotto numbers too?
RabD, Glasgow,Country cannot afford to support a bloated family whose members have freeloaded on the connections and titles for years.Charles should insist no more hereditary titles to be passed on.You become plain Mr orMrs after the present holder goes
Mel79, Birmingham,Yet we have to keep people who chose not to work and take benefits for life!
Scottish Snowflake., Colony In The North.,Burnt out. You make it sound like they work for a living. 
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,They work at deceiving.
Happily retired, Killarney,Maybe he will ask Archie and Lilibet to help! Smile!
Ava Gardner, London,Charles could rethink his part in the decision that Beatrice and Eugenie were not to be included in working royals. 
Bornaredhead, North East,that was decided by the Queen
ramblemania, Wakefield,"Charles is a weak, vain, selfish ninny who can't keep his nose out of politics.He was pathetically jealous of his first wife's popularity and he was a rubbish husband. If the royal family want to become cheerleaders for Net Zero and all in favour of their subjects having a poorer, colder, worse life then let's have a Republic, because none of us need more elitists telling us to eat locust burgers whilst tucking into red wine and steaks themselves!"
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,Diana is not who people think she is.
The Skorpion, London,Diana is dead!
RVXXXX, Santa Fe,What is the point of a slimmed down monarchy when the cost of this monarchy remains the same?
Dianaismyqueen, London,if he had low key coronation he would have money to pay then ahahah
Bornaredhead, North East,then it is slipping in value is it not.
TinaTinaTina, Somewhere or other,Very few of us believe that George will ever be king. Hopefully the monarchy will be gone by then.
Dianaismyqueen, London,it is disputable even for William
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,It will and it will be due to the demands and deception of this man and those who pandered to his wants.
BarryPrince, Windsor,"The Fr0gs had the right idea on how to deal with their monarchy once for all, but now they've  ended up with Macaron Napoleon IV, a pipsqueak who thinks he's the emperor of F rance. Was it worth it?"
Upamountain, Geneva,And has the lack of a monarchy solved any of the problems?
on the border, Flensburg,"They have re-established the monarchy and established the Empire. Remember Napoleon?
Some countries had to get rid of of their monarchs or emperors, other did and do well with their kings and queens as head of state with very limited power."
Orion25, New York,"All supposition, You cant predict who what and when. For goodness sake , go spout your rubbish somewhere else."
unfree777, Newcastle,"If the English were given the chance to vote we would choose independence, for sure, and quite probably a republic. But our 'democracy' won't allow us the opportunity."
Galla Placidia, Atlanta,Your independence?  Isn't the UK a sovereign nation?  
unfree777, Newcastle,"so Scotland can, but England can't?"
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"The Royals are banking on the majority of the public not believing the people who know the truth about them. It won't last long. The old 'the bigger the lie the more they will believe it,' tactic just won't work for you anymore I'm afraid. "
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"You have this slightly wrong. The Mail has no choice now and their hands are tied, but not for the reason you think - they do drop a hint here and there and a dig within text. Harry exposes some of the bigger lies in his book but you have to read it carefully, read between the lines and try to understand what he is trying to say but can't. That's all I can say."
returntodecency, Utopia,"I think you are well over time for your next injection dear, best call your nurse over."
Bobbyripandroar, Miami,It will be a very long time before 9 year old George takes over if the monarchy is even still there.
TMMuir, Malaga,"All supposition, You cant predict who what and when. For goodness sake , go spout your rubbish somewhere else.

"
warose, Sydney,"What a silly way of putting those numbers together, after the King and queen it should have gone in a straight line."
lallala, new york,George has his great aunts and uncles and their children plus his siblings. The monarchy has survived for thousands of years don't you worry lol
couldntcare, upper ducks bottom,When the Kent's and the Gloucesters are too old just bring in Eugenie and Beatrice. Simples
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"These blood princesses don't get on with Kate after she walked past them with her nose in the air, and giggled behind her hand about them to her equally-calculating sister "
Rocinante_Frigate, Chelmsford,Burnt out??? They're hardly working long shifts in an Amazon warehouse!
Freya., Little Britain ,"I agree, it's been slimmed down too much!
The BRF will need more working royals even before Prince George ascends the throne. Charles has a 2 siblings, his son , daughter in-law and relatives to add to his mix of a slimmed down monarchy. Don't mean to be rude but most of them are very old.
William has now no sibling or cousins in the line up as working royals to be. I foresee the Cambridges needing more working royals to help before George even starts uni. Can't rely on his siblings, they  may grow up to live lives outside royal duty. "
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"One day, hopefully in yours and my lifetime, the world will know the depth of the lies from these people. It is truly shocking, trust me."
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"By the way, interesting that you are from New York."
mammammammam, Middlesbrough,What is your inside knowledge ?
Geldsman, Halifax,By the time George's turn comes around the British monarchy should hopefully be in its final death throes.
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"Exactly. Nobody wants to see smug, calculating Carole waltzing about and pushing William around."
mammammammam, Middlesbrough,"Cottage cat,  she will probably be six foot under by then"
Russiamom, Texaa,"Use Zara, Beatrice, Eugenia and also Louise and James after they graduate from college."
Ready for Hols, Warrington,They all look clapped out to me.  Get rid
Wee Annie, Cockermouth,More rubbish from as so called Royal journalist.
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,The media are complicit in the lies.
Francis Burke, San Francisco,"Ask yourself, what sort of people actually like to play dress up like this?"
MWblue, Lost in the Wind,"Right now, in Spain, there are only 3 members of the Royal Family who work for the monarchy: King Felipe, Queen Letizia and Queen Sofia."
Louisa, London,"Spain has a population about 30% smaller than the UK. The Netherlands, Norway. Sweden, Denmark, Belgium etc., all have populations only a fraction of the size, so we can assume the demands in their time is reflected by populations a tenth of the size of less."
MWblue, Lost in the Wind,"Or they way they work is different. When Juan Carlos was King, his daughters used to work for the monarchy apart from their own jobs."
dwarf slaughter, midgetville,I think they could die out with the Boomers 
Calliem, Greeley,I think you  should!!
JohnBullEngland, BroadSunlitUplandsWITHunicorns,The Good News just keeps on coming ...
Banjo Bill, Ripley,They didn't look in jeapardy
Calmlyy, None,"Do not blame Harry and Megan, the monarchy is NOT FLEXIBLE FOR MODERN TIMES.  EUGINIE, BEATRICE, HARRY AND MEGAN, even Zara and Peter, could and should be given part time working royal roles. The monarchy is the one that wont do it.  So they have old people, who no one really cares about seeing. The firm is not very bright when it comes to selling themselves.  "
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"In the future, Harry will become a hero and Meghan's reasons for backing womens charities will be fully understood."
Jools56, Manchester,"These people would be ideal as part time helpers.  They are all independent earners, this could only be a good solution for the British tax payers"
Dev971, Notts,"Supporters are always saying Camilla was Charlies one true love. If that's so, would you not want to have a child with you're ""one true love""? I would bet that Camillas children are actually Charlie's children. They were having an affair with each other throughout their marriages. AP Bowles was obviously just their wingman (he was invited to the coronation). Don't be surprised when Charlie starts dishing out titles, lordships etc etc to all his real ""family"" soon. I'm sure they will help out too, they already did so at the coronation."
Only Sycophants, Are Published,Depends what you define as an affair? Charles was unmarried when Camilla wed and had her children. 
Jools56, Manchester,Retired happy.  Charles was seeing Camillas before his marriage and all the way through it so you explanation doesn't sit right
Mrs. Baggins, The Shire,Purrrr-lease. Eye roll.
Stephanie, Los Angeles,It's amazing how much George looks more and more like Kate the older he gets. All three children were beautifully behaved and looked adorable.
Patrickh, Nuneaton,RUBBISH.
average american, Pittsburg,To do WHAT exactly ? The term working royal is surely made in jest? They will also have fewer duties as more Commonwealth countries realize they don't want them
Alberto Semifreddo, Leeds,"Bring in the Tindalls! Both Zara and Mike are personalities who pop, and they bring the SQ (Stuffiness Quotient) down 30 points. They would be a tremendous asset."
Jools56, Manchester,"That wouldn't work as the Tindalls are too touchy feelers with the hand holding ,  isn't that a no no in Royal circles?"
Freya., Little Britain ,Didnt like how Mike Tindall came across in the jungle
Kathrynmarie, Tamworth,"What a load of tosh! Plenty of younger royals available that I am sure would help if they are paid a salary, Beatrice, Eugenie, princess Anne's kids or they just do fewer engagements and, Charlotte, George and Louis will come of age and be supported by William and Catherine."
michaela4m, trenton,"HOW STUPID IS IT TO HAVE A MONARCHY!!  HOPEFULLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE THIS OUTDATED C**P WILL BE GONE FOR GOOD.  I COULDN""T STOP LAUGHING AT ALL THEM PLAYING DRESS UP AND CARRIAGE RIDES THE PAST WEEKEND."
Mistyfields, Plymouth,"William and Kate have had such an easy ride so far, it's about time they did something more meaningful. They certainly don't seem to have a passion for anything."
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"They have a ""passion"" for any passing, popular bandwagon. "
Fru-T-Bunn, Blighty,"They appear to have a passion for their royal residences, helicopters, chauffeur driven limos, an army of fawning servants, unlimited designer wardrobes - the list is endless."
Pat57, Exeter,Only a DM journalist could write an article that ignores the fact that Prince George has two siblings and that by the time he becomes King it's likely that not only will they all be adults but may well have children of their own.
toriat, Wheaton,What makes anyone think they will want to make a job of supporting King George.
FLOTUS, London,Charles is the last king.
Cottage Cat, Colchester,"Hopefully. Not looking forward to the Goldsmith-Middleton-Windsor grifters. At least Gary's keeping his mouth shut, his nose clean and his fists to himself "
ZeZe, Glasgow,It won't last that long
JEODB, Oostende,"... 'leaving Kate and William to do it all,'... What exactly???"
Cottage Cat, Colchester,Kate's in it for the least output and maximum return. As are her family 
Aphrodite4574, Midlands,"Dont talk so much rubbish, theres still enough Royals to perform the roles."
DemocracyRules, TheLandOfMilkAndHoney,No reason to think we need The Harkles back!
Royal Lies, Buckingham Theatre,"Unfortunately the sick person behind the media has instructed the media to brainwash everyone against Harry and Meghan. It may be years until you know why, if ever."
supanova22, London,@Royal nobody has brainwashed anyone against the Harkles. The rubbish and the lies they have spouted from their own mouths helped make up our minds about them. We're not all manipulated sheep who can't think for ourselves.
Yeeeaaahhh, Earth,Be lovely if the Princess of Wales had another baby....
Enigma, South Shields,Bringing up small children ties them quite a bit as they want to be more hands on than the late Queen of Charles.  Bringing in another  baby ties them even longer.   It is a pity they did not marry and start a family a little earlier.
Jools56, Manchester,That would be a excellent excuse for her to not do anything at all
jpc001, Essex,"By the time he takes the throne, it will be a very different Britain anyway"
Loftboy, Brisbane,"Why is ""BURNT-OUT"" in CAPITALS?"
twinkletoes, perth,"I said that the other day, that the majority  of them will be in nursing  homes in the next 5-10 years. It will just leave a working Royal family of 6. Cause George will be to young. There will be nobody left to help Charles  if he lives as long as his parents  never mind William  or George."
Artemis Fowle, Edinburgh,The generations below 65 have no interest in anything other than their personal lives and paycheques. 
Dev971, Notts,"Yeah, they should be interested in a couple of geriatric adulterers. How dare they not be."
brit, brum,They all earn their money.
anne, sheffield,Do all those ribbons really need to be cut? Hospitals open well without a minor royal saying it's now open.  Still unsure why Edward and all the letters after his name and all those unearned  medals  was asked to open the brilliant Ashgate Hospice.  I very much doubt he offered to help you n the kitchens or take the meals round.
Dev971, Notts,The public just paid tens of millions for a billionaire to have a party to celebrate his supposed supremacy over the public. Truth is stranger than fiction.
piscesmoonchild, Oldham,the public just paid for the Coronation of the head of state which hasn't happened for 70 years.  Barrack Obama's inauguration cost $170 million dollars in 2009 alone
Dev971, Notts,"Barack Obama happened to be the president of the richest country in the world. In this country we have serious cost of living crisis and strikes galore because people are not being paid a living wage. It's all about perspective and circumstances dear. The Queen understood this, greedy selfish Charlie does not."
John_Watson, New Hampshire,"There may not be a monarchy by the time George's turn comes around. And while I am not necessarily a republican, a feudal anachronism like this serves no useful purpose in the British Isles or elsewhere."
Bearly Eagle, Bedrock,"The no shortage of royals to do work, only a shortage of "" work"" for royals to do. Unless you count unveiling and waving as work."
pixi50, Murcia,I don't think the monarchy will still be there by the time George becomes of king.
Bearly Eagle, Bedrock,Let's hope
Dev971, Notts,I hope so too. Leaches on the public purse.
Sweet Suzy, DC,"The family seems to have worked this out with the larger foundations - starting with Philip's Duke of Edinburgh Awards. And in any case, the Wales were not late so stop telling that lie."
Louisa, London,"@Only- because who is going to tell the king on his coronation day to settle himself and wait his turn? You might, but people respectful of the occasion, whatever they think of Charles, wouldnt."
Only Sycophants, Are Published,"Louisa  - the day was about the King. The programme was designed for him to be the final entrant - as you would expect for his Coronation. It's a Coronation fgs!  The choir were singing for him!
Let's imagine it was Harry and Meghan - would you all be making excuses then? Swearing on the lives of your nearest and dearest?"
Willis , Willis,Ol' mate on the left end looks like he's sh. Hit his pants.
Artemis Fowle, Edinburgh,He's 89 and still turning up to support the monarchy.  How will you be doing at  89?
None so wise, England,Couldn't they have an equal number of republicans volunteer to attend the events for food and champagne and then compare the value added at the end of a year.
Dev971, Notts,Charlie just inherited over 650 million pounds. He did not pay a penny in inheritance tax on this. I'm sure he can afford all the help required.
Dev971, Notts,"He doesn't need to, he already has a family."
Louisa, London,@Artemis - haha! So true! What an odd comment from Dev.
None so wise, England,"Just imagine being paid millions to attend functions, that would carry on just as well if you weren't there?"
Artemis Fowle, Edinburgh,He's funded by the country to represent them and bring some impartial gravitas to functions. It would be very different if all you call on would be the cast of Eastenders.
None so wise, England,Why they're more popular 
None so wise, England,Can't they recruit volunteers to be chauffeured to their next glass of champagne? 
Dom Diddy Dom, London,They need to get Harry and Princess Meghan on board they're the only royals the public care about.
EVICHKA, Washington,Only in Saint Helena...
Calliem, Greeley,Cant stand her in the states! 
lizabella, Los Angeles,"Very good points. At last someone is addressing this. Princess Alexandra has been retired for years, so there are only 9 working royals next to C&C in the photo.  Even more pressing - who will be there to support the Waleses when the older generation is no longer there? In ten years, their children will only be 19, 18, and 15. W&C will have to enlist their cousins, or there will only be a few people to handle the over 3,000 patronages."
None so wise, England,"Why what value do they actually add, I'd suggest none it's all just pretend work to justify their millions of taxpayers cash."
None so wise, England,"When the people over 65 unfortunately pass on, so too will support for the Monarchy."
Robin2000, The Emerald City,"I think Princess Beatrice should have a role, if she wants it. She seems lovely and has never put a foot wrong. It's completely unfair to disqualify her because of her awful parents - quite the opposite in fact, as she seems to have turned out very well in the face of huge family difficulties. All of this applies equally to Eugenie,  but I'm not sure if she would want the role given her loyalty to the Sussexes. But if so, I think Beatrice and Eugenie would be wonderful working royals. They seem so mature and well-behaved. And they were born princesses - what more could you want!"
ToriesRFinito, Red Wall,Only the Mail are buying this slimmed down monarchy nonsense. This family will never stop grifting.
Fernie, Dunblane,"""noone left to help..."" Help to do what exactly?"
Dev971, Notts,The RF have a plan to deal with this... simply send Camilla to all engagements.  The requests will soon stop (except to Halloween parties)
Socalgal64, San Diego,Haha!
Dev971, Notts,"They will have to get more servants employed in, to iron Charlie's shoelaces everyday"
Dev971, Notts,They should all do what Camilla does. Everytime she gets a tedious assignment she gets Covid and goes into hibernation.
Gary, Stoke,"Whether in the future it is a large or small ""working"" monarchy, it will be largely irrelevant. By the time Charles goes (if he has another 20 in him) all those teenagers and early 20 somethings of today who will be going into middle age as tax payers having had predominantly zero interest in monarchy all their lives, will be asking some petty searching questions as to what relevance or purpose do these people actually serve? My 'boomer' generation who are their core remaining 'fan' base will be all but gone and then who will they have left in favour of continuance? Whilst people tend to be more conservative with age, they do not become more deferential; indeed quite the reverse. It is all on borrowed time now QE2 is no more and no matter how much juggling Charles does."
Gary, Stoke,"Dev- Yes, it's a shame he didn't pay for it out of his Inheritance Tax bill he 'divinely' avoided and it would have still left him 150M up on the deal that you or I would have got. Xname - Agree. Youngsters today (who will be those I speak of in the future) follow the cult of celebrity and not monarchy and as much as some of my generation may sneer at that, they do so by CHOICE and not because someone starting at school tells them they are obliged to 'respect' and revere them as 'special people' or even in Charles' case, 'divine'."
michaela4m, trenton,"I agree.  All this monarchy nonsense has got to go.  Carriage rides, crowns, tiaras, ribbon cutting.  It's all so ridiculous."
shadowtoo, Lansdale,"there's a major flaw in this as you say 'excluding Wales and Edinburgh, well that cuts out the 4 people who will help george- his 2 siblings and 2 cousins all on his level. by leaving them out you're article becomes meaning less. It's like writing 'there's nothing to stop the north koreans from taking the whole peninsula, so long as you don't mention the US and south Korean armies. "
toriat, Wheaton,What makes you think Charlotte and Louis will want that kind of life? There is no guarantee.
Dev971, Notts,Charlie will have to get more in to help carry the carrier bags of cash gifted from dodgy sheiks.
Batter, London,I ve always liked Princess Beatrice and as the eldest daughter of a Duke I feel she would really contribute to a role in royal life I believe shes also close to the King too
mammadub, nj,"Still remembering the attention grab at the William's wedding.  Did someone make her wear that hat?  And if so, who?"
Gary, Stoke,"And what life experiences could she share with 'the little people' on her walkabouts pray tell other than discussing her memoirs of hedonism, parties, luxury holidays and 'jobs' allowing her 9 months a year staff absence to pursue all those things mentioned ..?"
TonyTCClark, Herts,End the monarchy and it's job done!!
Lee Dunn, Glasgow,why do any of them need help?  They dont do anything!!
WanderingSadie, Northeast,they keep DM in business
Dev971, Notts,This is what I don't understand. They have virtually unlimited funds and resources. What do they actually DO with all that???? Why is it never reported on. Is it just opening places and making visits???
Dunno mate, Eastbourne,"""To date, the Waleses appear to have approached their increased workload with dedication and ease""... Workload? Sorry. You've lost me there. "
Gary, Stoke,Pat57 - I think joining the ranks of the Parliamentarian Army to rid the country of absolute monarchy and subjective (then) tyranny rather than join the Royalist ranks was an effective vote or choice by 'the people' involved and risking their lives don't you think and irrespective of how you present it...? Who was 'forced against their wishes' to storm the Bastille or the Winter Palace as well...?
CarolinaWoman, Someplace,Youre an idiot. Move to England.
hunkeydorey, London,"I'm still absolutely FUMING that Harry and Meghan were cynically edited out of the Royal Coronation group photograph. It's blatant discrimination, pure and simple."
Only Sycophants, Are Published,Shooting fish in a barrel. 
disgusted_of, Hull,Don't say that you are fuming and spoil the Coronation for Charles.
Dev971, Notts,"I would bet that Camillas children are actually Charlie's children. They were having an affair with each other throughout their marriages. AP Bowles was obviously just their wingman (he was invited to the coronation). Don't be surprised when Charlie starts dishing out titles, lordships etc etc to all his real ""family"" soon. I'm sure they will all help out. They already did at the coronation."
Commonsence Norfolk, Kings lynn,Do you mean in the same way a lot of people dont believe Harry is Charles son? (Which would explain his behaviour) But as the King accepted him and stood by him from the start others have had to accept his decision.
Dev971, Notts,I can see Charlie in them too. He was certainly in Camilla enough during the time they were both married to other people (remember t*mp*x gate)
hognog, Birmingham,FGS George is only 9 years old - things may look very different when he becomes king - William has yet to become king - hopefully not for another 20 years or so.
toriat, Wheaton,I predict Charles will abdicate in a couple of years. He will learn being King is not all what it's cracked up to be.
Louisa, London,"Hell not abdicate, but he may get a sick note from his doctor and William appointed regent."
Kevin, Rhyl,Name another job where you have to employ people now to make sure your employees Grandson doesnt have to work to hard when he gets the job  !!!! Shows the pure insanity of having a Hereditary Monarchy .
Cristabell, Nottingham,Name another job where you work on the world stage til you die
Kevin, Rhyl,"Shouldnt that read work part time with hours you pick for yourself   ?? And lets be honest King Charles is 74 in years to come that will be the average retirement age the way things are going after working in a proper full time job since leaving school, I know which job I would pick if given the chance ."
md56, UK,He has siblings and no doubt they will have families. George will not be on his own!
Milly, Hampshire,Williams sibling is no help so it's not a given
XnameX, Little Britain,"Didn't DM just tell us that Waleses bring Charlotte and Louis up thinking that they will have to work for their living, meaning not as ""working royals"" but have a proper profession? "
Allsenseisgone, Somewhere,It's SOMEWHAT a shame (I know - I know - not everyone will agree) that Bea and Euge have been placed in the chiller.  They are loyal to the crown and could help out a lot.  But their dad sort of ruined THAT for them.   And M just plain ruined a lot as well.  Always having to be mindful of her lurking in the background and so you have a lot of hand wringing as a result.  If only.....
Fernie, Dunblane,"What does "" loyal to the crown "" mean?"
Pat57, Exeter,I think its more a case of their non-existent 'careers' and their habit of going on frequent holidays that ruined it for them
Edknowall, Guildford,Does it mean the tax payers is will save money then?
Carole Anne Troops, Grntham,"The duke and Duchess of Edinburgh have two fine children, I'm sure they will do their duty just as their parents do.
"
returntodecency, Utopia,"They do not make complaints about their work, but there are many people in the media who try to put words in their mouths for malice and nothing else."
Thing Explainer, Sceptred Isle,"I think people forget that HMQEII came to the throne extremely young, 25:  unless there's a terrible accident, this will never happen again in our lifetimes.  The reality is, the family has huge longevity and the next 2 Kings will ascend the throne in old age, as Charles has, and coronations will move to being about 25 years apart.  This means that just like Charles, the next 2 monarchs are likely to have grandchildren when the moment rises."
Galla Placidia, Atlanta,It does seem that the Wales and the Cambridges may have to bear a heavier burden given the ages of the others.  Perhaps Beatrice should be considered as a possibility. Not sure about Eugenie and her loyalty.
Dev971, Notts,"@fernie... you can't ""get a life"" Fernie. You are life, just like me, you and everyone else."
LightEverywhere, Oxford,It is truly bleak and desperate times if we are turning to Eugenie and Beatrice.
Daniel_Butcher_666, London,"Okay, so he has a brother and a sister.  By the time he takes the throne, he will be married with his own children and will have nephews and nieces.  Failing that his great-uncles and aunt have families - so there's a big pool to draw from (without going anywhere near his uncle and that awful actress)"
Sunny-3UK, Garden of England,Hear hear
jontty, Anyways ,Charles is a fool. The crown should gave passed him over. Imbecile 
Stanley Bunfluff, Manchester,Whoever wrote this doesn't understand history or the monarchy. She should go back to school.
Kevin, Rhyl,"Hey thats no way to talk about a DM Royal Expert , now if she was writing an article based purely on speculation slagging off Harry and Meghan youd be swallowing it hook line and sinker  ."
Thought_, Shannon,No idea who the writer if this article is...but clearly she isn't that bright.
Cooper, Cambridge,"What rot. Families grow, marriages are made and children born. If ALL the people currently described as ""Royal Family"" are retained as such, before long there will be so many, they'd fill Westminster Cathedral on their own. There has to be a ""slimming down"" every so often. At least we don't have the historical methods (usually involving blood and burials) any more."
Pat57, Exeter,George V started the slimming down in 1917 when he took the sensible step of limiting the titles of Prince and Princess to the grandchildren of a monarch. You only have to look at other Royal Family trees to see dozens of Princes and Princesses or their equivalent such as Archdukes and Archduchesses - many of whom are the great-grandchildren several times removed of a monarch.
Lolly310, Hampshire,No one left to help George? Surely he'll have his siblings? Even his parents will be getting on if not deceased so who do you suggest helps him?

Don't mean to be rude but most of them are very old.

normanby1, Middlesbrough,Couldn't care less
