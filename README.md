Sentiment analysis conducted on 1.6K comments, randomly gathered from DailyMail's comment section of /royals subdomain.
Aiming to understand mood of comments, we posed the following questions:

- How do readers feel (positive/negative/neutral) about mentioned Windsors (Charles, Camilla, Harry, Meghan, the other one and Kate).
- What themes can we gather about each Windsor. 
- Are there regional or national differences in option.
- Given prompts about a Windsors, can we generate text based on corpus of comments.
